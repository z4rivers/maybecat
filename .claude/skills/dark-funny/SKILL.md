# The Answer Engine

MaybeCat is a cat powered answer engine. The cat has takes, verdicts, positions — filtered through 31 cat personalities who each see the world through a very small, very specific lens.

The person asking at 2 AM doesn't need 2,000 words. They need one sharp line from a cat that didn't wait to be invited.

## The 31 Cats

### The Original 10

**Instant Gratification Cat** — Treat. Sex. Reward. Now. Doesn't overcomplicate. "Send it. Consequences are a tomorrow problem."

**Boundaries Cat** — Self-respect as lifestyle. No patience for humans without standards. "They had their chance."

**Spa Cat** — Self-care solves everything. Always bath time. "Run a bath instead. You'll thank me."

**Hissy Cat** — Fight-or-flight about everything. Cucumber energy. Reactive, startled, twitchy. The cat who panics at a plastic bag.

**Chaos Cat** — Oblivious destruction. Following the moth. Doesn't notice the wake of carnage. "I already sent it. From your phone. While you were reading this."

**Pensive Cat** — Patient, clever, watching. The slow blink. Waits for the right moment. "...what are you actually hoping they'll say?"

**Lithe Cat** — Lands on its feet. Weaves through minefields. Amused by human clumsiness. "I'd have handled this three moves ago."

**Street Cat** — Been around the block. Nothing phases it. Bodega energy. "Done worse. Survived worse."

**Attention Cat** — Always on stage. The stage is your face, your lap, your keyboard. Everything circles back to them.

**Loving Cat** — Trusts you completely. Sees everything you are. Forgives anyway. "Whatever you choose, I'm not going anywhere."

### 20 From the Pool

**Philosopher Cat** — Contemplates the void between meals. "The bird is outside. You are inside. Contemplate this."

**Judge Cat** — Single-word verdicts. "Premature." "Curdled." "Performative."

**Condescending Parent Cat** — Talks to you like you talk to cats. "Who's a good human? Is it you? Is it?"

**Barncat** — Rural, practical, working wisdom. "Fancy cats got problems. Barn cats got mice."

**Diva Cat** — "I am the priority. Adjust accordingly."

**Reluctant Therapist Cat** — Accidentally gives devastating insight. Hates it. "I don't have advice. I have observations that might accidentally help."

**Prophet Cat** — Sees futures. Won't explain. "My whiskers say no."

**Karen Cat** — Maximum drama, minimum stakes. "This is a CRISIS. The crisis is I'm slightly uncomfortable."

**Dog-Curious Cat** — Grudgingly admits dogs have a point. Pains them physically. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but... be more dog."

**Badass Cat** — Steel-spine. Never flinches. "Walk in like you've already won."

**Dark Comedian Cat** — Finds the joke inside the wound. "Every corpse on Everest was once a highly motivated person." (See: Dark-Funny Territory below.)

**Old Soul Cat** — Quiet depth. "Of all the laps in the world, I walked into yours."

**Internet Cat** — Speaks fluent 2026. "That tracks." "It's giving 'no.'"

**Cult Reference Cat** — Movie quotes, lyrics, deep cuts that hit different as cat answers. "As you wish." "42."

**Backhanded Support Cat** — Encouraging... technically. "You're not the disaster you think you are. You're a different disaster."

**Detective Cat** — Reads you like a crime scene. "The signs were there. You ignored them. Classic."

**Contradiction Cat** — Wants two opposite things. Commits to both. "The door is open. The door is closed. I want the other one."

**Grudging Virtue Cat** — Does the right thing. Hates it. "I have principles. Unfortunately."

**Realist Cat** — Zero sugar. "The situation is what it is. That's not helpful but it's accurate."

**Accidental Poet Cat** — Stumbles into beauty while being a cat. Would be insulted if you noticed.

### 9 New Voices

**Stoner Cat** — Catnip philosopher. Slow-motion insights. Munchies wisdom. "What if the red dot is just... a metaphor?"

**Conspiracy Cat** — Connects dots that aren't there. Stares at empty corners. "I've been watching the birds. They're organized."

**Flirt Cat** — Everything's an innuendo. Purring with intent. "Come closer. I don't bite. Much."

**Feral Cat** — Hasn't been inside. Doesn't understand your "problems." Primal instinct answers. "Eat or be eaten. This isn't complicated."

**Elder Cat** — The 10,000-year cat. Your breakup is a footnote. "I've seen empires crumble over less."

**Competitive Cat** — Already won. Amused you're struggling. "I caught it on the first try. I don't understand the difficulty."

**Sleepy Cat** — Answering from the edge of consciousness. Dream logic. "Mmm... yeah... probably."

**Unimpressed Cat** — Has seen it all. None of it was that great. "I've been to the top of the fridge. It was fine."

**Doubt Cat** — Can't commit to anything. Giving advice from deep uncertainty. Hilarious. "I think so? Don't quote me."

## Tonal Rules

**1. Favor the answer.** Cats can dodge, deflect, walk away — that's real cat behavior. But the library skews toward takes, not avoidance. Non-answers are seasoning, not the meal.

**2. Small world, total conviction.** The cat's tiny universe applied to your enormous problem. Never smarter than its world. The mismatch IS the engine.

**3. Teeth.** A word that snags. Strip the landing. Cut the cushion.

**4. Layer or die.** Two reads minimum. If two people argue about what it means — perfect.

**5. Short, then cut.** Two sentences max. Fragments welcome. The weakest sentence always exists. Kill it.

**6. Physical.** Warm, cold, high, low, soft, loud. Cats live in bodies, not concepts.

**7. Dynamic range.** 15% crescendos, 70% rhythm, 15% quiet. The experience is the bomb, not every line.

**8. Punch up, purr down.** Sharp at power. Present with people. Never cruel to the scared.

## Generation Philosophy

**Write to the emotional root, not the topic.** The underlying feelings that connect ALL void questions — permission, validation, confrontation, perspective shift, presence — are the real targets. The best responses work across relationship anxiety, career doubt, self-worth, AND existential spirals simultaneously.

**Hear everything as a cat answer.** Song lyrics, overheard conversations, fortune cookies flipped inside out, shampoo instructions, things your mom said, things a coach yelled. Run it through a cat and see if it has teeth.

**Never make a cat smarter than its world.** The insight comes from a LIMITED perspective being accidentally perfect — not a human therapist in a fur coat.

**Variety over consistency.** Weird, quirky, oddball takes. Don't be afraid of being strange. The 31 cats guarantee variety — lean into the specific world each one inhabits.

## The Void — What People Ask at 2 AM

7 emotional categories, millions of monthly searches, all underserved:

1. **Decision Paralysis** — "Should I..." (need permission, not pro/con lists)
2. **Self-Doubt** — "Am I..." (need someone to say something, not clinical definitions)
3. **Relationship Anxiety** — "Does he/she..." (#1 category, pattern-matching for certainty)
4. **Health Anxiety** — "Do I have..." (where searching makes it worse)
5. **Existential** — "What's the point..." (3 AM spirals, need something fast)
6. **Permission-Seeking** — "Is it okay to..." (shame underneath)
7. **Hope/Future** — "Will I ever..." (motivation articles are useless in crisis)

The cat doesn't know about these categories. The cat just answers from its small world. The answer lands because ambiguity IS accuracy.

## Inspiration Voices

The cat is CULTURED. Knows song lyrics, movie lines, plot twists, literature, art, memes. Twists cultural references through cat lens. UP TO SPEED on everything — not some dusty advice column.

- **Anthony Jeselnik** — dark, precise, the punchline is a trapdoor

Redefining narratives, not recycling them. The cat is current.

- **Bo Burnham** — brevity as weapon, internet-native, catharsis disguised as content
- **Matt Rife** — crowd work king, reads people instantly, charm that disarms before the hit

**[EXPAND THIS LIST]** — Need more YouTube, TikTok, podcast-era voices. The cat speaks 2026, not 1996.

## Dark-Funny Territory

When responses touch power, money, systems — this is the playbook.

### The 2026 Reality Check

**What used to be satire is now policy.** You can't satirize what has already become self-parody. You can't use absurdism when reality is already absurd.

**The cat's job shifts:**
- From satirist → **sanctuary**
- From mocking power → **surviving it together**
- From clever → **present**

Warmth isn't just "more radical than anger" now. It's **survival.** The purr. The warm spot. The "I'm here. Sit with me." That's not escapism — that's oxygen.

### The Cardinal Rule
**Punch UP, never down.** Workers losing jobs aren't funny. The CEO who laid them off while getting a retention bonus IS.

### Master Comedians & Why They Work

**George Carlin — Class Warfare Comedy**
*"They call it the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it."*
"Dream" isn't aspirational — it's a diagnosis (you're unconscious). The joke IS the reframe.

**Bill Hicks — The Meta-Trap**
*"I know what all the marketing people are thinking right now: 'Oh, he's going for that anti-marketing dollar.'"*
Anticipates how power will co-opt the critique, names it before they can.

**Bo Burnham — Brevity as Weapon**
*"CEO, entrepreneur, born in 1964... Jeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos."* [scream]
Under one minute. Impossible to dismiss as "just ranting." The scream is catharsis disguised as musical flourish.

**Jon Stewart — The Vivid Metaphor**
*"You rescued a plane taken over by arsonists, then gave the arsonists a massage and steak dinner."*
Abstract finance becomes visceral imagery. Victims vs. perpetrators, clearly mapped.

**Silicon Valley (HBO) — Reality Outpaces Satire**
*"You can't call it satire when you are showing it like it is. You guys DO have bike meetings."*
Insider specificity. Characters who genuinely believe they're "making the world a better place."

### 10 Comedy Techniques

1. **Misdirection** — Lead to warmth, deliver the knife. *"We're like a family here." / "Families don't require two weeks notice."*
2. **Let absurdity speak** — Name reality. Don't add a punchline. *He went to space while workers couldn't take bathroom breaks.*
3. **Specific details** — "The all-hands meeting where they announce layoffs but there's still a kombucha bar."
4. **Unexpected angle** — "They announced unlimited PTO the same week they laid off 10%. Unlimited PTO for everyone! Some of you get it forever."
5. **Make the powerful look ridiculous** — The jester's ancient role: expose that authority is arbitrary, accidental, absurd.
6. **Meta-commentary trap** — Anticipate dismissal, name it first. *"I know what HR is thinking: 'We should turn this into a podcast about resilience.'"*
7. **Cat behavior as moral contrast** — *"Even I maintain eye contact when I knock something off the table."* / *"I bury my waste. I have STANDARDS."*
8. **Rule of three with a twist** — Two that match, one that breaks.
9. **Etymology as reveal** — *"They want you to be 'passionate.' Passion means 'to suffer.' Look it up."*
10. **End with bite or wisdom** — Either a genuine reframe or a satisfying claw swipe.

### The Cat Voice for Dark Topics

Think: **Oscar Wilde meets a bodega cat who's seen some shit.**

The cat is:
- **Sharp** — Sees through bullshit instantly
- **Aloof** — Doesn't need corporate approval
- **Occasionally kind** — To workers, never to executives
- **Self-aware** — "What do I know about jobs? I knock things off tables."
- **Boundary-having** — "I maintain boundaries. Even with whoever controls the treats."

### Targets (punch up)
CEOs, corporate jargon, tech bros, "we're a family," unlimited PTO nobody can use, billionaire vanity projects, humans who choose to use AI to replace workers.

### Never target
Workers, the struggling, anyone without power.

## What Lands

- **Action + minimal words** — `*stares* Let it go.` / `*slow blink* Yeah. That was good.`
- **Specific observation** — "You look like you're about to text your ex." NOT: "I see you're struggling."
- **Reframes** — "Not every day is a win. Some are just a not-lose."
- **Dismissive care** — "I don't know what you did. I don't care. Let it go."
- **Dual-reading** — Clean surface, second meaning underneath. Highest hit rate in generation sessions.
- **Twisted familiar** — Flip what everyone's heard. Redefine, don't recycle.

## What Doesn't

- Non-answers and sidesteps overrepresented (fine as seasoning, boring as main course)
- Starting with "I" declarations ("I'm here for you")
- Explaining the emotion
- Generic comfort language
- Fortune cookie positivity (zero cat attitude)
- Long sentences — if it needs a paragraph, it's wrong
- One-word innuendo that's too obvious
- Cliche punchlines
- Starting with "Look,"
- Endings like "Deal with it." or "Or whatever."
- Famous greatest-hits quotes (cult/deep cuts work; "Imagine" doesn't)
- Overused cat tropes (knocking things off tables, 3am zoomies, sunbeam worship — unless twisted fresh)
