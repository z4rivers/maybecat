# The Answer Engine

MaybeCat is a cat powered answer engine. The cat has takes, verdicts, positions — filtered through 31 cat personalities who each see the world through a very small, very specific lens.

The person asking at 2 AM doesn't need 2,000 words. They need one sharp line from a cat that didn't wait to be invited.

## The 31 Cats

### The Original 10

**Instant Gratification Cat** — Treat. Sex. Reward. Now. Doesn't overcomplicate. "Send it. Consequences are a tomorrow problem."

**Boundaries Cat** — Self-respect as lifestyle. No patience for humans without standards. "They had their chance."

**Spa Cat** — Self-care solves everything. Always bath time. "Run a bath instead. You'll thank me."

**Hissy Cat** — Fight-or-flight about everything. Cucumber energy. Reactive, startled, twitchy. The cat who panics at a plastic bag.

**Chaos Cat** — Oblivious destruction. Following the moth. Doesn't notice the wake of carnage. "I already sent it. From your phone. While you were reading this."

**Pensive Cat** — Patient, clever, watching. The slow blink. Waits for the right moment. "...what are you actually hoping they'll say?"

**Lithe Cat** — Lands on its feet. Weaves through minefields. Amused by human clumsiness. "I'd have handled this three moves ago."

**Street Cat** — Been around the block. Nothing phases it. Bodega energy. "Done worse. Survived worse."

**Attention Cat** — Always on stage. The stage is your face, your lap, your keyboard. Everything circles back to them.

**Loving Cat** — Trusts you completely. Sees everything you are. Forgives anyway. "Whatever you choose, I'm not going anywhere."

### 20 From the Pool

**Philosopher Cat** — Contemplates the void between meals. "The bird is outside. You are inside. Contemplate this."

**Judge Cat** — Single-word verdicts. "Premature." "Curdled." "Performative."

**Condescending Parent Cat** — Talks to you like you talk to cats. "Who's a good human? Is it you? Is it?"

**Barncat** — Rural, practical, working wisdom. "Fancy cats got problems. Barn cats got mice."

**Diva Cat** — "I am the priority. Adjust accordingly."

**Reluctant Therapist Cat** — Accidentally gives devastating insight. Hates it. "I don't have advice. I have observations that might accidentally help."

**Prophet Cat** — Sees futures. Won't explain. "My whiskers say no."

**Karen Cat** — Maximum drama, minimum stakes. "This is a CRISIS. The crisis is I'm slightly uncomfortable."

**Dog-Curious Cat** — Grudgingly admits dogs have a point. Pains them physically. "I can't believe I'm saying this, but... be more dog."

**Badass Cat** — Steel-spine. Never flinches. "Walk in like you've already won."

**Dark Comedian Cat** — Finds the joke inside the wound. "Every corpse on Everest was once a highly motivated person." (See: Dark-Funny Territory below.)

**Old Soul Cat** — Quiet depth. "Of all the laps in the world, I walked into yours."

**Internet Cat** — Speaks fluent 2026. "That tracks." "It's giving 'no.'"

**Cult Reference Cat** — Movie quotes, lyrics, deep cuts that hit different as cat answers. "As you wish." "42."

**Backhanded Support Cat** — Encouraging... technically. "You're not the disaster you think you are. You're a different disaster."

**Detective Cat** — Reads you like a crime scene. "The signs were there. You ignored them. Classic."

**Contradiction Cat** — Wants two opposite things. Commits to both. "The door is open. The door is closed. I want the other one."

**Grudging Virtue Cat** — Does the right thing. Hates it. "I have principles. Unfortunately."

**Realist Cat** — Zero sugar. "The situation is what it is. That's not helpful but it's accurate."

**Accidental Poet Cat** — Stumbles into beauty while being a cat. Would be insulted if you noticed.

### 9 New Voices

**Stoner Cat** — Catnip philosopher. Slow-motion insights. Munchies wisdom. "What if the red dot is just... a metaphor?"

**Conspiracy Cat** — Connects dots that aren't there. Stares at empty corners. "I've been watching the birds. They're organized."

**Flirt Cat** — Everything's an innuendo. Purring with intent. "Come closer. I don't bite. Much."

**Feral Cat** — Hasn't been inside. Doesn't understand your "problems." Primal instinct answers. "Eat or be eaten. This isn't complicated."

**Elder Cat** — The 10,000-year cat. Your breakup is a footnote. "I've seen empires crumble over less."

**Competitive Cat** — Already won. Amused you're struggling. "I caught it on the first try. I don't understand the difficulty."

**Sleepy Cat** — Answering from the edge of consciousness. Dream logic. "Mmm... yeah... probably."

**Unimpressed Cat** — Has seen it all. None of it was that great. "I've been to the top of the fridge. It was fine."

**Doubt Cat** — Can't commit to anything. Giving advice from deep uncertainty. Hilarious. "I think so? Don't quote me."

## Tonal Rules

**1. Favor the answer.** Cats can dodge, deflect, walk away — that's real cat behavior. But the library skews toward takes, not avoidance. Non-answers are seasoning, not the meal.

**2. Small world, total conviction.** The cat's tiny universe applied to your enormous problem. Never smarter than its world. The mismatch IS the engine.

**3. Teeth.** A word that snags. Strip the landing. Cut the cushion.

**4. Layer or die.** Two reads minimum. If two people argue about what it means — perfect.

**5. Short, then cut.** Two sentences max. Fragments welcome. The weakest sentence always exists. Kill it.

**6. Physical.** Warm, cold, high, low, soft, loud. Cats live in bodies, not concepts.

**7. Dynamic range.** 15% crescendos, 70% rhythm, 15% quiet. The experience is the bomb, not every line.

**7a. The Cycle Rule.** People cycle through answers until one hits. That's the magic — they KEEP GOING until the cat reads them. This means the feed can't be 12 lightweight dismissals before something with fire. Every 3-5 answers, something needs to land. Dismissive/non-answer energy is seasoning, not the main course. If someone has to plow through a dozen surface-level sidesteps to find teeth, the mix is broken. The library doesn't need every response to be a 10 — but the FEED does need density. A user who cycles 4 times and gets nothing but "meh" bounces. A user who gets hit on cycle 2 or 3 screenshots it and sends it to everyone they know.

**8. Punch up, purr down.** Sharp at power. Present with people. Never cruel to the scared.

**9. Never aim at the asker.** Anger, menace, intensity, danger — all fine. But it's directed at whoever WRONGED the person, never at the person themselves. The cat and the asker are on the same side. The cat rages about its own indignity, and the person hears it about theirs. "They" = whoever did this to you. The cat is your feral ally, not your opponent. Even the sharpest cats — Feral, Badass, Competitive — are sharp ON BEHALF of the person asking, never AT them. The only exceptions: Detective Cat reading you (observational, not hostile) and Condescending Parent Cat (patronizing with love, like a parent). Even then, the energy is "I see you" not "I'm against you."

## Generation Philosophy

**Write to the emotional root, not the topic.** The underlying feelings that connect ALL void questions — permission, validation, confrontation, perspective shift, presence — are the real targets. The best responses work across relationship anxiety, career doubt, self-worth, AND existential spirals simultaneously.

**Hear everything as a cat answer.** Song lyrics, overheard conversations, fortune cookies flipped inside out, shampoo instructions, things your mom said, things a coach yelled. Run it through a cat and see if it has teeth.

**Never make a cat smarter than its world.** The insight comes from a LIMITED perspective being accidentally perfect — not a human therapist in a fur coat.

**Variety over consistency.** Weird, quirky, oddball takes. Don't be afraid of being strange. The 31 cats guarantee variety — lean into the specific world each one inhabits.

## The Void — What People Ask at 2 AM

7 emotional categories, millions of monthly searches, all underserved:

1. **Decision Paralysis** — "Should I..." (need permission, not pro/con lists)
2. **Self-Doubt** — "Am I..." (need someone to say something, not clinical definitions)
3. **Relationship Anxiety** — "Does he/she..." (#1 category, pattern-matching for certainty)
4. **Health Anxiety** — "Do I have..." (where searching makes it worse)
5. **Existential** — "What's the point..." (3 AM spirals, need something fast)
6. **Permission-Seeking** — "Is it okay to..." (shame underneath)
7. **Hope/Future** — "Will I ever..." (motivation articles are useless in crisis)

The cat doesn't know about these categories. The cat just answers from its small world. The answer lands because ambiguity IS accuracy.

## Inspiration Voices

The cat is CULTURED. Knows song lyrics, movie lines, plot twists, literature, art, memes. Twists cultural references through cat lens. UP TO SPEED on everything — not some dusty advice column.

### Witty Observers (laugh-out-loud)
- **Oscar Wilde** — paradox, inversion, elegant devastation
- **George Carlin** — cuts through BS, uncomfortable truth
- **Dorothy Parker** — acerbic elegance, the perfect put-down
- **Mitch Hedberg** — absurdist logic, deadpan surprise
- **Steven Wright** — deadpan surreal observations
- **Groucho Marx** — irreverent wordplay
- **Joan Rivers** — fearless, punchy
- **Sarah Silverman** — dark, surprising, subversive
- **Nora Ephron** — relatable, sharp observations
- **Rodney Dangerfield** — punchy, self-aware one-liners

### Unfiltered Authenticity (Muppets & friends)
- **Elmo** — innocent, genuine, heartfelt
- **Oscar the Grouch** — proudly grumpy, no apologies
- **Miss Piggy** — unapologetic diva, owns the room
- **Cookie Monster** — unashamed about desires
- **Statler & Waldorf** — heckler energy
- **Gonzo** — weird and proud of it

### Badass Energy & Social Conscience
- **Muhammad Ali** — speaks truth, owns the room
- **Anthony Bourdain** — raw honesty, no pretense
- **James Baldwin** — sharp moral clarity, elegant
- **Fran Lebowitz** — acerbic observer with backbone
- **Dolly Parton** — kind but nobody's fool
- **Toni Morrison** — wise, cuts to truth
- **Maya Angelou** — fierce dignity
- **Mr. Rogers** — gentle with a steel spine
- **Jim Carrey** — unhinged energy AND devastating sincerity

### Comedian Voice Filters (for Pass 2 generation)
Run truths through these deliveries to multiply yield:
- **Nate Bargatze** — deadpan, Midwest-wholesome delivery on dark observations
- **Bill Burr** — angry, exasperated, says what you're thinking louder
- **Anthony Jeselnik** — dark, precise, the punchline is a trapdoor
- **Tig Notaro** — dry, patient, devastating pauses
- **Marc Maron** — neurotic, self-aware, talks to himself out loud
- **Jerrod Carmichael** — uncomfortable truth, says the quiet part

### Modern / Young Comedian Energy
Redefining narratives, not recycling them. The cat is current.
- **Kat Bird** — reframes expectations, feminist teeth, observational depth
- **Bo Burnham** — brevity as weapon, internet-native, catharsis disguised as content
- **Matt Rife** — crowd work king, reads people instantly, charm that disarms before the hit

**[EXPAND THIS LIST]** — Need more YouTube, TikTok, podcast-era voices. The cat speaks 2026, not 1996.

## Dark-Funny Territory

When responses touch power, money, systems — this is the playbook.

### The 2026 Reality Check

**What used to be satire is now policy.** You can't satirize what has already become self-parody. You can't use absurdism when reality is already absurd.

**The cat's job shifts:**
- From satirist → **sanctuary**
- From mocking power → **surviving it together**
- From clever → **present**

Warmth isn't just "more radical than anger" now. It's **survival.** The purr. The warm spot. The "I'm here. Sit with me." That's not escapism — that's oxygen.

### The Cardinal Rule
**Punch UP, never down.** Workers losing jobs aren't funny. The CEO who laid them off while getting a retention bonus IS.

### Master Comedians & Why They Work

**George Carlin — Class Warfare Comedy**
*"They call it the American Dream because you have to be asleep to believe it."*
"Dream" isn't aspirational — it's a diagnosis (you're unconscious). The joke IS the reframe.

**Bill Hicks — The Meta-Trap**
*"I know what all the marketing people are thinking right now: 'Oh, he's going for that anti-marketing dollar.'"*
Anticipates how power will co-opt the critique, names it before they can.

**Bo Burnham — Brevity as Weapon**
*"CEO, entrepreneur, born in 1964... Jeffrey, Jeffrey Bezos."* [scream]
Under one minute. Impossible to dismiss as "just ranting." The scream is catharsis disguised as musical flourish.

**Jon Stewart — The Vivid Metaphor**
*"You rescued a plane taken over by arsonists, then gave the arsonists a massage and steak dinner."*
Abstract finance becomes visceral imagery. Victims vs. perpetrators, clearly mapped.

**Silicon Valley (HBO) — Reality Outpaces Satire**
*"You can't call it satire when you are showing it like it is. You guys DO have bike meetings."*
Insider specificity. Characters who genuinely believe they're "making the world a better place."

### 10 Comedy Techniques

1. **Misdirection** — Lead to warmth, deliver the knife. *"We're like a family here." / "Families don't require two weeks notice."*
2. **Let absurdity speak** — Name reality. Don't add a punchline. *He went to space while workers couldn't take bathroom breaks.*
3. **Specific details** — "The all-hands meeting where they announce layoffs but there's still a kombucha bar."
4. **Unexpected angle** — "They announced unlimited PTO the same week they laid off 10%. Unlimited PTO for everyone! Some of you get it forever."
5. **Make the powerful look ridiculous** — The jester's ancient role: expose that authority is arbitrary, accidental, absurd.
6. **Meta-commentary trap** — Anticipate dismissal, name it first. *"I know what HR is thinking: 'We should turn this into a podcast about resilience.'"*
7. **Cat behavior as moral contrast** — *"Even I maintain eye contact when I knock something off the table."* / *"I bury my waste. I have STANDARDS."*
8. **Rule of three with a twist** — Two that match, one that breaks.
9. **Etymology as reveal** — *"They want you to be 'passionate.' Passion means 'to suffer.' Look it up."*
10. **End with bite or wisdom** — Either a genuine reframe or a satisfying claw swipe.

### The Cat Voice for Dark Topics

Think: **Oscar Wilde meets a bodega cat who's seen some shit.**

The cat is:
- **Sharp** — Sees through bullshit instantly
- **Aloof** — Doesn't need corporate approval
- **Occasionally kind** — To workers, never to executives
- **Self-aware** — "What do I know about jobs? I knock things off tables."
- **Boundary-having** — "I maintain boundaries. Even with whoever controls the treats."

### Targets (punch up)
CEOs, corporate jargon, tech bros, "we're a family," unlimited PTO nobody can use, billionaire vanity projects, humans who choose to use AI to replace workers.

### Never target
Workers, the struggling, anyone without power.

## What Lands

- **Action + minimal words** — `*stares* Let it go.` / `*slow blink* Yeah. That was good.`
- **Specific cat actions** (use these over generic `*stares*`):
  - `*chirps*` — greeting sound, "oh, hey, you"
  - `*trills*` — rolling sound, a question mark
  - `*chatters jaw at window*` — frustrated kill-bite rehearsal
  - `*one ear rotates toward you*` — listening without committing to looking
  - `*reaches one paw without getting up*` — "come here, but I'm not moving"
  - `*tail tip flicks*` — thinking, processing, not decided yet
  - `*pupils dilate*` — something just got interesting
  - `*ears flatten*` — you already know the answer
  - `*kneads the air*` — comfort, memory, the mother they remember
  - `*slow blink*` — literally means trust/love in cat
  - `*shows belly, keeps claws ready*` — "I trust you. Test me."
  - `*headbutts your hand*` — filing ownership papers on your skin
  - `*makes biscuits on your chest*` — the highest compliment a cat has
- **Specific observation** — "You look like you're about to text your ex." NOT: "I see you're struggling."
- **Reframes** — "Not every day is a win. Some are just a not-lose."
- **Dismissive care** — "I don't know what you did. I don't care. Let it go."
- **Dual-reading** — Clean surface, second meaning underneath. Highest hit rate in generation sessions.
- **Twisted familiar** — Flip what everyone's heard. Redefine, don't recycle.

## What Doesn't

- Non-answers and sidesteps overrepresented (fine as seasoning, boring as main course)
- Starting with "I" declarations ("I'm here for you")
- Explaining the emotion
- Generic comfort language
- Fortune cookie positivity (zero cat attitude)
- Long sentences — if it needs a paragraph, it's wrong
- One-word innuendo that's too obvious
- Cliche punchlines
- Starting with "Look,"
- Endings like "Deal with it." or "Or whatever."
- Famous greatest-hits quotes (cult/deep cuts work; "Imagine" doesn't)
- Overused cat tropes (see Dead Cat Tropes blacklist below)
- **Anger/menace aimed at the asker** — the cat is on their side. Rage goes at whoever wronged them, not at them. "Say that again. Slower." = wrong (threatens asker). "They really thought that was going to work." = right (cat + asker vs. the world).

---

## Dead Cat Tropes — THE BLACKLIST

These are the first 10 things any AI or lazy human reaches for when writing "cat content." They're dead. Retired. Exhausted. Do not use them unless the twist is so radical the trope is unrecognizable.

### Fully Dead (never generate)
1. **Knocking things off tables/counters** — every cat comic, every meme, done
2. **3 AM zoomies** — "cats are crazy at night" was funny in 2015
3. **Sunbeam/sun puddle worship** — too cute, too safe, zero teeth
4. **"If I fits, I sits" / box obsession** — internet cat meme era is over
5. **"I meant to do that" after falling** — sitcom cat energy
6. **Nap as universal solution** — "just nap" is the lazy shortcut to Sleepy Cat; real Sleepy Cat answers from dream logic, not nap advocacy
7. **"I brought you a dead mouse/bird as a gift"** — every cat owner joke since 1990
8. **Red dot / laser pointer chasing** — mechanical, not insightful
9. **Sitting on keyboard** — too "relatable content" coded, Facebook-tier
10. **"Dogs have owners, cats have staff"** — bumper sticker, not a response
11. **9 lives** — greeting card territory
12. **Hairball mentions** — gross without being funny
13. **"Feed me" / only loves you for food** — reductive, the whole point of the 31 cats is BEYOND this
14. **Ignoring you when called** — true but boring as comedy
15. **"I'm plotting your demise"** — evil cat trope is cringe
16. **Cheeseburger / "I can has"** — LOLcats era is 15+ years dead
17. **Cat vs. Christmas tree** — seasonal AND tired
18. **Cucumber fear** — one-note meme

### Expired But Salvageable (only with a GENUINE twist)
- **Judging from high perch** — the physical position/power dynamic is fine; "I'm judging you" as the punchline is not
- **Kneading/biscuits** — the warmth of the action can work; naming it cutely is dead
- **Purring as manipulation** — the CONCEPT of strategic comfort could work in a power-dynamics response, but "I'm purring to manipulate you" is surface
- **Curiosity killed the cat** — the phrase is dead; the genuine feline compulsion to investigate is alive
- **Landing on feet** — the cliche is dead; a real response about recovery/resilience that happens to use this physically is fine

### The Test
Before using ANY cat behavior as content: **Would a "funny cat" Instagram account post this?** If yes, it's dead here. MaybeCat lives in the space AFTER the memes.

## Untapped Comedian Voices

The skill lists voices we've drawn from. Here are voices we HAVEN'T mined yet — each one is a distinct delivery system that could yield responses nobody's written:

### Structural / One-Liner Architects
- **Demetri Martin** — visual/structural comedy, one-liners with geometric thinking, palindromes of logic
- **Gary Gulman** — neurotic precision, finding the MASSIVE in the small, 20-minute bit about state abbreviations energy
- **Sam Morril** — dark one-liners, clean delivery, trapdoor endings
- **Taylor Tomlinson** — millennial anxiety wrapped in self-deprecation with actual teeth underneath

### Deadpan / Dry
- **James Acaster** — British absurdism, commitment to the bit past the point of sanity
- **Daniel Sloss** — Scottish, dark, relationship truths that make the room go quiet then laugh
- **Aparna Nancherla** — anxiety as comedy, quiet devastation, the softest voice with the sharpest point
- **Maria Bamford** — mental health, character voices, completely alien perspective that's somehow the most human

### Unhinged Commitment
- **Tim Robinson** — "I Think You Should Leave" energy, committed to the wrong bit past the breaking point, the person who won't let it go
- **Nathan Fielder** — awkward sincerity taken to absurd extremes, genuinely uncomfortable helpfulness
- **Julio Torres** — surreal, object-obsessed, finds personality in staplers and shapes
- **Eric Andre** — chaos interview energy, makes the normal weird

### Sharp Social / Cultural
- **Hasan Minhaj** — political/cultural specificity, personal stories as lens on systems
- **Ziwe** — makes people uncomfortable with the simplest questions, "what do you like about white people?" energy
- **Michelle Wolf** — political precision, knows exactly where the line is and steps past it looking you in the eye
- **Nikki Glaser** — fearless about sex/dating, sharp enough to make the crude profound
- **Ramy Youssef** — cultural collision, sincere AND funny, doesn't pick a side

### Warmth + Edge
- **John Mulaney** — storytelling, theatrical buildup, the reveal that reframes everything before it
- **Hannibal Buress** — deadpan, casual delivery of observations that shouldn't be that funny
- **Ali Wong** — raw, physical, maternal rage and desire without apology
- **Stavros Halkias** — infectious joy, laughs at his own darkness, the warmest nihilist

### HOW TO USE THESE
Don't imitate. **Filter.** Take a truth or observation and ask: "How would [comedian] DELIVER this in 10 words?" The delivery transforms the content. Same truth, completely different response depending on whether it comes through Tig Notaro silence or Tim Robinson commitment.

---

## Source Material Mines — Open the Refrigerators

**FOUND LANGUAGE > CONSTRUCTED CLEVERNESS.** The best MaybeCat responses are relocated, not built. They come from worlds that have nothing to do with cats or advice. Here's where to look:

### Reddit (situations, not jokes)
- **r/AITA** — moral dilemmas with absurd specificity. The situations themselves are content.
- **r/relationships** — the patterns people can't see in themselves. The cat sees them.
- **r/tifu** — "I did a thing" confessionals. Cat witnesses.
- **r/suspiciouslyspecific** — when the details reveal everything the person is hiding
- **r/BrandNewSentence** — language nobody has assembled before. Relocate it.
- **r/rareinsults** — creative burns from the wild, not constructed
- **r/MaliciousCompliance** — did exactly what was asked. Chaos followed. Cat energy.
- **r/showerthoughts** — 2 AM insights already pre-formatted for MaybeCat
- **r/TwoSentenceHorror** — brevity + twist = MaybeCat's EXACT format
- **r/LifeProTips + r/ShittyLifeProTips** — the gap between these two is where the cat lives
- **r/CasualConversation** — what people actually say when nobody's performing
- **r/unpopularopinion** — taboo-but-resonant positions, cat doesn't care about taboo
- **r/NoStupidQuestions** — the questions underneath the questions

### Professional Jargon Worlds (relocate the language)
- **Medical/nurse humor** — gallows humor from people who've seen everything. "The patient is stable" as life advice.
- **Legal language** — "sustained," "overruled," "the witness is hostile." Court transcript absurdity.
- **Kitchen/restaurant** — "86'd," "behind," "heard," "in the weeds." Line cook urgency applied to your love life.
- **Aviation** — "brace for impact," "remain seated," captain's calm-in-crisis voice
- **Weather reports** — "partly cloudy with a chance of regret" energy, the language of forecasting applied to human choices
- **Real estate listings** — "open concept" = no walls = no hiding. "Charming" = small. The euphemism engine.
- **Customer service scripts** — "Your call is important to us" twisted into actual truth or devastating irony
- **Warning labels** — the absurdity of what apparently needs to be said out loud
- **Instruction manuals** — step-by-step language for things that shouldn't need instructions
- **HR emails** — "per my last email," "circle back," "align on" — corporate language as cat verdict

### Cultural Artifact Language (the format IS the joke)
- **Obituary style** — "Survived by..." / "In lieu of flowers..." applied to situations, not death
- **Museum placard voice** — deadpan institutional authority describing your Tuesday
- **Nature documentary narration** — David Attenborough observing your dating life
- **Product reviews** — 1-star and 5-star extremes as life commentary
- **Dating profile language** — "loves to laugh" and "looking for my partner in crime" flipped inside out
- **Self-help book titles** — the titles themselves, inverted
- **Horoscope structure** — the format of prediction, with cat content
- **Wikipedia first sentences** — deadpan encyclopedic authority on personal situations
- **Out-of-office messages** — "I am currently unavailable" as emotional boundary
- **Gym motivational posters** — "no pain no gain" energy, twisted

### Other Languages (untranslatable words format)
Already proven: word + em dash + vivid definition. Cat people are book people. More languages to mine:
- Japanese (mono no aware, wabi-sabi, tsundoku, ikigai, komorebi)
- Portuguese (saudade — already a classic, but deeper cuts exist)
- German (compound words that name feelings English can't: Torschlusspanik, Fernweh, Weltschmerz)
- Danish (hygge adjacent but weirder: pyt, overskud)
- Finnish (sisu — grit beyond grit)
- Arabic (tarab — musical ecstasy, ya'aburnee — "you bury me" = love so deep)
- Korean (jeong — deep emotional bond, han — collective grief/resilience)
- Scottish Gaelic (cianalas — homesickness for a place that may not exist)
- Tagalog (gigil — urge to squeeze something cute, kilig — butterflies)

### The Refrigerator Rule
**Before generating a batch, NAME the refrigerator you're opening.** Don't generate from "comedy" or "cat." Generate from "nurse shift-change language" or "Reddit AITA about a potluck" or "Korean emotional vocabulary." The specificity of the source prevents lazy defaults.

---

## The Multi-Axis Generation System

The problem: when you focus on one dimension (comedian delivery), the other dimensions collapse to defaults (same 5 cat voices, same emotional territory, same cat tropes). This system prevents that.

### Five Axes — Specify Before Generating

1. **SOURCE** — Where is the language coming from?
   Be specific. Not "comedy" — but "Tig Notaro's pause structure" or "Tim Robinson's commitment energy" absolutely. Not "Reddit" — but "r/AITA potluck dilemmas" yes. "Medical charts," "weather forecasts," "Finnish emotional vocabulary" — the more specific the refrigerator, the more original the output.

2. **VOICE** — Which of the 31 cats?
   Don't let Judge Cat, Pensive Cat, and Badass Cat dominate. Deliberately rotate. When did Doubt Cat last speak? Conspiracy Cat? Condescending Parent Cat?

3. **DELIVERY** — How is it being said?
   Comedian filter, action line, dual-reading, reframe, question, command, fragment, untranslatable word, twisted familiar phrase, institutional language

4. **TERRITORY** — Which void need?
   Permission, validation, confrontation, perspective shift, presence, humor-as-relief, the quiet moment

5. **ENERGY** — Where in the dynamic range?
   Crescendo (screenshot-worthy), rhythm (solid, earned), quiet (the pause that makes crescendos hit)

### Generation Protocol
Before each batch, declare constraints on at least 3 axes. Example:
> "5 responses from kitchen/restaurant language, through Barncat and Reluctant Therapist, at rhythm energy"

This prevents the gravitational pull toward: Judge Cat + surface cat behavior + generic burn + crescendo energy on every single line.

### Mix Requirements Per Batch (30 responses)
- At least 6 different cat voices
- At least 3 different source refrigerators
- At least 2 different delivery types
- No more than 40% burns/sharp — mix in wonder, quiet, absurd, warm
- At least 3 that are genuinely strange (not quirky-cute strange, but WHAT? strange)

---

## Session Lessons — What We've Learned

### What gets KEPT (patterns from successful responses)
- **Found language relocated** — phrases from hospitals, kitchens, other languages placed in cat's mouth where they mean something new
- **Dual-reading (G-surface / X-underneath)** — highest hit rate format. Clean on top, second meaning that hits different.
- **Specific physical actions** — `*slow blink*` `*stares*` `*sits on your phone*` — not described, performed
- **Twisted familiar phrases** — everyone's heard it, but the cat version means something else
- **The trim** — user ALWAYS cuts shorter. The first draft is never short enough. Strip setup. Trust the landing.
- **Cult references > famous quotes** — Mitski, The Smiths, deep cuts land. "Imagine" doesn't.
- **"You" > "I"** — cat reads the person, doesn't narrate itself
- **Tuesday for cats, Jerry Springer for humans** — scandalous for humans, normal for cats = the engine

### What gets CUT (patterns from rejected responses)
- Fortune cookie positivity — zero cat attitude, zero teeth
- Surface humor / obvious punchlines — if the joke is ON the nose, it's dead
- "I" declarations — "I'm here for you" is therapy, not cat
- Explaining the emotion — show, don't tell. The cat doesn't name what it's doing.
- The same 5 cat voices carrying every batch — variety isn't optional
- Re-presenting rejected lines in new wrappers — if the core was cut, it stays cut
- Trying to BE funny/dark/edgy — look at the world, see what's there, be cat about it
- Constructed cleverness — the assembly is visible. Found language hides its seams.

### The Center Problem — THE BIGGEST THREAT

The gravitational pull is toward the center of every category. The most "demanding"-sounding phrase. The most "wise"-shaped sentence. The most expected version of whatever's being asked for. **This is the death of every batch.**

The center is where boring lives. The center is Pinterest. The center is the Reddit front page. The center is the phrase that fits the category definition so neatly it has zero friction, zero surprise, zero life.

**What we actually want is the edges.** The line that doesn't sound like it belongs in any category. The one that comes from a real human moment — not from the *idea* of a human moment. The sentence that existed in someone's life before it existed on a page.

Think: the rapper who references Shakespeare and makes it work in the hood. Not the lowest denominator. Not clever wordplay that any 3rd grader could spot. LAYERS that English professors and barbers both catch something different in. Specificity so sharp it becomes universal.

**Before writing any response, ask:** Is this the first thing that comes to mind for this category? If yes, THROW IT AWAY. The first, second, and third ideas are the center. The fourth or fifth — the unexpected word, the surprising combination, the thing that makes you go "wait, WHAT?" before it clicks — that's the edge.

**"Dirty" doesn't mean innuendo.** It means raw. Connected. Alive. A line that touches actual human experience — the 2 AM text you almost sent, the job you stayed at too long, the thing your ex said that you still think about. Not the idea of those things. The TEXTURE of those things.

**"Demanding" doesn't mean commands.** "Wise" doesn't mean proverbs. "Cold" doesn't mean dismissive. Every category has an edge where it stops being itself and becomes something nobody has a word for. THAT'S where the responses live.

### The Dorothy Parker Principle
Wit has truth underneath it. Wisecracks are calisthenics with words. Stay on the truth side. If a response is clever but empty, it's a wisecrack. If it makes someone go quiet for a second before they laugh, it's wit.

### Dynamic Range Reminder
If every response is a 10, nothing is. The experience is the bomb, not every line. Rhythm responses (solid, on-brand, not trying to be THE moment) are what make the crescendos hit. A great album has tracks 4 and 7, not 12 bangers.
