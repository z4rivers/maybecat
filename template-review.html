  <h1>Template Review</h1>

  <div class="note">
    <strong>The Problem:</strong> Templates combine patterns + slots to generate responses. The frames often add nothing ("Ancient cat proverb:") and the combinations can be clunky. But some slot content is good on its own.<br><br>
    <strong>Options:</strong> KEEP template as-is | KILL entirely | EXTRACT good slot content as standalone responses
