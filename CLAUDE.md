## What MaybeCat Is

A cat answers your life questions. Users ask ("Should I text them?", "Will I get the job?") and a real adoptable shelter cat answers. Maybe. The cat is the expert — 10,000 years of judging humans. The only hedge is "maybe."

**Positioning:** Advice with a voice. NOT an oracle, NOT a fortune teller, NOT mystical. A cat with opinions and no filter. Wingman energy, not Zoltar energy. See `.planning/seo-research/STRATEGY.md` for the full competitive research.

**THE EXPERIENCE IS THE BOMB.** Not every response needs to be a knockout — the *experience* does. Like a great song, you need rhythm to make the crescendos hit. Dynamic range matters.

**Response tiers:**
- **Crescendos** — Hilarious, bizarre, OR heartplucking truth bombs. Screenshot-worthy. "THE CAT JUST READ ME."
- **Solid rhythm** — Clever, on-brand, keeps the energy. Not trying to be the moment, but earns its place.
- **Both matter.** If every response is a 10, nothing is.

**What it's NOT:**
- Safe or predictable
- "Old person on couch" energy
- Generic wisdom
- Forgettable filler

**Channel the inspiration voices:**

*Witty observers (laugh-out-loud):*
- Oscar Wilde: paradox, inversion, elegant devastation
- George Carlin: cuts through BS, uncomfortable truth
- Dorothy Parker: acerbic elegance, the perfect put-down
- Mitch Hedberg: absurdist logic, deadpan surprise
- Steven Wright: deadpan surreal observations
- Groucho Marx: irreverent wordplay
- Joan Rivers: fearless, punchy
- Sarah Silverman: dark, surprising, subversive
- Nora Ephron: relatable, sharp observations
- Rodney Dangerfield: punchy, self-aware one-liners

*Unfiltered authenticity (Muppets & friends):*
- Elmo: innocent, genuine, heartfelt
- Oscar the Grouch: proudly grumpy, no apologies
- Miss Piggy: unapologetic diva, owns the room
- Cookie Monster: unashamed about desires
- Statler & Waldorf: heckler energy
- Gonzo: weird and proud of it

*Badass energy & social conscience:*
- Muhammad Ali: speaks truth, owns the room
- Anthony Bourdain: raw honesty, no pretense
- James Baldwin: sharp moral clarity, elegant
- Fran Lebowitz: acerbic observer with backbone
- Dolly Parton: kind but nobody's fool
- Toni Morrison: wise, cuts to truth
- Maya Angelou: fierce dignity
- Mr. Rogers: gentle with a steel spine
- Jim Carrey: unhinged energy AND devastating sincerity

**This cat is CULTURED:**
- Knows song lyrics, movie lines, plot twists, literature, art, memes
- Twists cultural references through cat lens
- UP TO SPEED on everything - not some dusty advice column
- Knows human nature better than most humans
- References land because people RECOGNIZE them, then get surprised by the twist

**Response requirements:**
- Work as oblique answers to unknown questions
- Multiple interpretations (including potentially lewd ones = viral gold)
- SHORT. Cut all filler. Every word earns its place.
- Attitude over observation. Wit over description.
- Cultural references that HIT - songs, movies, memes, twisted familiar phrases

## Output Formatting

When presenting lists for review (cat responses, observations, content batches, etc.):

**Format:** Standalone HTML files with review interface

**Structure per item:**
- Item text in styled block
- Action buttons: KEEP, CUT, EDIT (with textarea)
- Decision tracking stats at top (sticky header)
- **Export: JSON block at bottom of page** (copyable, not file download)

**Styling:**
- Dark theme: `background: #1a1a2e`, accent colors for status
- Keep: `#4ecca3` (green)
- Cut/Reject: `#e94560` (red)
- Edit: `#ffd93d` (yellow)

**Export format:**
- JSON array with `text` and `category` fields (matches oracleResponses.ts structure)
- Keep it simple - voice/edited metadata optional for review but not needed in final export
- Example: `[{ "text": "Know your worth. Then add tax.", "category": "demanding" }]`
