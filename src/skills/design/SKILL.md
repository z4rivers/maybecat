# The Refined Apothecary System

**Critique**: Reject "Country German" / "Saloon" aesthetics. No heavy blocks. No chunky borders.
**Vision**: Fine Etching, Museum Labels, Scientific Precision. "Paper on Glass".

## 1. The Line Weight Rule
*   **Primary Borders**: Max `1px` or `2px`.
*   **Detail Lines**: `0.5px` or `1px`.
*   **Style**: Double-lines (pinstripes) are preferred over single thick lines.

## 2. The Shape Language: "Die-Cut Paper"
We mimic physical paper labels stuck to glass bottles.
*   **The Button (The Label)**:
    *   **Fill**: Cream (`#FFFBEB`) or Deep Black (`#1c1917`).
    *   **Border**: Contrast Ink (Black or Gold).
    *   **Shape**: Complex Die-Cut. Not just rounded. Inverted corners, chamfers, or "Ticket" shapes defined by **SVG Paths**.
    *   **Shadow**: Subtle, sharp drop shadow (paper lift), not heavy blur.

## 3. The Frame: "The Specimen"
The Cat is a specimen or a portrait in a fine book.
*   **Matting**: Generous whitespace around the image.
*   **Border**: Thin, intricate ink lines enclosing the image.
*   **Corner Details**: Finely drawn vector ornaments, not constructed divs.

## 4. Typography
*   **Headlines**: `Cinzel Decorative` (The Brand).
*   **Body**: `Georgia` (The Description).
*   **Color**: High contrast Ink on Paper.

## 5. Visual Density
*   Use **Engraved Separators** (horizontal lines with varying width).
*   Use **Negative Space** to let the fine lines breathe.

## 6. Subtractive Design
**When in doubt, remove it.**
*   Taglines, subtitles, explanatory text — often unnecessary clutter.
*   If the name is strong, it doesn't need a tagline.
*   If the button is clear, it doesn't need helper text.
*   Every element must EARN its space. Default is deletion.
*   **MaybeCat lesson**: Removed tagline entirely. Result: "So beautiful without the clutter."
