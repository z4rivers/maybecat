# Plan 06-01: Set up Vitest

## Goal

Install and configure Vitest for testing the maybecat codebase.

## Why

- Vitest is fast, Vite-native, and works well with React
- No existing test setup in the project
- Needed before writing any tests

## Tasks

### Task 1: Install Vitest and dependencies
- Install vitest, @testing-library/react, @testing-library/jest-dom
- Install jsdom for DOM testing
- Install happy-dom or jsdom as test environment

```bash
npm install -D vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom
```

### Task 2: Create vitest.config.ts
- Configure test environment (jsdom)
- Set up globals for describe/it/expect
- Configure path aliases if needed

### Task 3: Add test script to package.json
- Add "test": "vitest" script
- Add "test:run": "vitest run" for CI

### Task 4: Create test setup file
- Create src/test/setup.ts
- Import @testing-library/jest-dom for matchers
- Configure any global test utilities

### Task 5: Verify setup works
- Create a simple smoke test
- Run `npm test` to verify everything connects

## Verification

- [ ] vitest installed in devDependencies
- [ ] vitest.config.ts exists
- [ ] package.json has test scripts
- [ ] src/test/setup.ts exists
- [ ] `npm run test:run` passes

## Notes

- Using jsdom for React component testing
- Vitest is already Vite-compatible, no extra config needed
