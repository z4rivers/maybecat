# Plan 05-02: Extract NameInputModal component

## Goal

Extract the name input modal from Home.tsx to `src/components/NameInputModal.tsx`.

## Why

- Modal is a self-contained UI piece (~57 lines)
- Reduces Home.tsx complexity
- Makes it reusable if needed elsewhere

## Current Code (lines 609-666)

The modal appears when user uploads a cat image and prompts for the cat's name.

**Props needed:**
- `isOpen: boolean` - controls visibility
- `onSave: (name: string) => void` - called when user confirms or skips

**Features:**
- AnimatePresence for enter/exit animations
- Styled card with corner flourishes
- Text input with Enter key support
- Skip and Confirm buttons

## Tasks

### Task 1: Create src/components/NameInputModal.tsx
- Create component file
- Accept props: isOpen, onSave
- Include all styling and animations
- Export component and props type

### Task 2: Update Home.tsx
- Import NameInputModal
- Replace inline modal with component
- Pass showNameInput as isOpen
- Pass handleNameSave as onSave

### Task 3: Verify build passes
- Run `npm run build`
- Confirm no type errors
- Modal behavior unchanged

## Verification

- [ ] src/components/NameInputModal.tsx exists
- [ ] Component accepts isOpen and onSave props
- [ ] Home.tsx imports and uses component
- [ ] npm run build succeeds
- [ ] Modal opens on image upload
- [ ] Skip and Confirm work correctly
- [ ] Enter key works

## Notes

- AnimatePresence wrapper stays in Home.tsx for proper exit animation
- Modal component renders the content inside AnimatePresence
