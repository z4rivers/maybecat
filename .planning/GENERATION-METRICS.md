### Comedian Filter Batches (Feb 10 2026)
| Batch | Generated | Kept | Rate | Comedy Logic | What Worked |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| **Nate Bargatze** | **30** | **11** | **37%** | **Deadpan uncertainty, "I don't know" energy** | **Doubt as delivery. "I'm gonna say yes but in a way where if it goes wrong I said maybe."** |
| Taylor Tomlinson | 30 | 1 | 3% | Self-deprecating, dating-era therapy | FAILED: all "I" statements. Framing rule born here. |
| Nikki Glaser | 30 | 4 | 13% | Sharp, sexual, self-aware | "Confidence is attractive. Delusion is confident. So. Math." |
| **Ali Wong V1** | **30** | **9** | **30%** | **Blunt, transactional, no-BS** | **Money reframes, body-over-brain, polite mask removal.** |

### Post-Comedian Batches — New Approaches (Feb 10 2026)
| Batch | Generated | Kept | Rate | Engine | What Worked |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

| Cat Metaphors V2 | 30 | 1 | 3% | Deeper cat-specific | Cat cliches are tired. Too safe. |
| Animated / Cosby | 30 | 6 | 20% | Over-the-top, recognition comedy | "The DRAMA. The SUSPENSE. The absolute THEATER." User trimmed heavily. |
| **Nice Angry** | **30** | **7** | **23%** | **Sweetest cat at its limit** | **CONTRAST is the engine. Nice + furious in same sentence. "I have chosen peace. Violently." vibes.** |
| **Brawler Poetic** | **30** | **7** | **23%** | **Poetry that's been in a fight** | **Ali promo energy. Adrenaline + beauty. "The quiet was the reload."** |
| Furry Roast | 30 | 5 | 17% | Real cat vs cosplayers | Specific TOPIC gave focus. "You're cosplaying my SPECIES." |

## Key Patterns

### What drives high hit rates:
1. **Constrained voice** — Specific comedian logic + specific cat = consistent output
2. **Comedy LOGIC, not comedian impression** — Mulaney's escalation structure works; copying his topics doesn't
3. **Contrast engines** — Nice-angry, brawler-poetic. Two opposing forces in one sentence.
4. **Specific topics** — Furry roast had focus. "Write 30 random" has none.

### What kills hit rates:
1. **"I" statements** — Cat navel-gazing. Taylor Tomlinson lesson: "You" > "I"
2. **Generic observations** — "The door is open" (anyone says that) vs "The food's not better in the other bowl" (only a cat)
3. **Cat cliches** — Knocking things off tables, 3 AM zoomies, sunbeam worship (unless twisted fresh)
4. **Setup + punchline format** — User ALWAYS cuts the setup. The punchline stands alone.
5. **Explaining the metaphor** — "That box won't hold you anymore. You're not the same size." → User cut sentence 2.
6. **All caps try-hard energy** — Animated batch had too much EMPHASIS

### User edit patterns:
- **Always trims shorter** — Strip the landing. Kill the second sentence.
- **Removes "I" framing** — "I have watched you survive" → "You've survived"
- **Removes setups** — "They thought the quiet meant I was done. The quiet was the reload." → "The quiet was the reload."
- **Adds "your"** — "The meow needs work" → "Your meow needs work" (aimed at person)
- **Rewrites to shift meaning** — "I forgive you, need a minute before I mean it" → "Need a minute before I mean what I'm about to say" (past → future, healing → loading)

## Next: Cat × Comedy Logic Pairings

**TODO:** Map which cat personalities × comedy logics create the most productive voices.
Hypothesis: 39 cats × 10 logics = 390 intersections. Even 30% interesting = 117 specific voices.
At 10 responses each with 25% hit rate = 292 keepers. Multiple rounds = 10K path.

**The user should drive the pairings** — which combinations feel right is a creative decision.
