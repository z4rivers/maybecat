<objective>
Import the gradient and effect token files into Figma via Tokens Studio, export them as Fill Styles and Effect Styles, and handle the two radial gradients that require manual creation. This completes all 6 Phase 3 requirements (GRAD-01 through GRAD-03, EFFECT-01 through EFFECT-03).

Purpose: The JSON files from Plan 01 become live, reusable Figma styles that can be applied to components in Phase 5+.

Output: 12 Figma Fill Styles (gradients) + 24 Figma Effect Styles (shadows) + documentation of manual items and EFFECT-03 assessment.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
Plan 01 created three files:
- `scripts/figma-tokens/gradients.json` -- 12 linear gradient tokens (page background, 7 card gradients, 3 button gradients, 1 divider)
- `scripts/figma-tokens/effects.json` -- 24 shadow tokens (15 box-shadow + 8 text shadow + 1 utility)
- `scripts/figma-tokens/manifest.json` -- Updated with 05 Gradients and 06 Effects collections
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>

**Step 1: Import token files into Tokens Studio**

1. Open the MaybeCat Figma file
2. Open Tokens Studio plugin (Plugins > Tokens Studio for Figma)
3. Import the updated token files from `scripts/figma-tokens/`:
   - If using local file sync: point to the `scripts/figma-tokens/` directory
   - If using manual import: import `gradients.json` and `effects.json` as new token sets, or re-import `manifest.json` to pick up both
4. Confirm Tokens Studio shows two new collections: **05 Gradients** (12 tokens) and **06 Effects** (24 tokens)
5. Check that gradient token references resolve (no broken reference warnings for `{pink.500}`, `{amber.400}`, `{card-pink.gradient-start}`, etc.)

**Step 2: Export to Figma Styles**

1. In Tokens Studio, select the **05 Gradients** collection
2. Export/push to Figma as **Fill Styles** (Tokens Studio: "Create styles" or "Sync to Figma")
3. Select the **06 Effects** collection
4. Export/push to Figma as **Effect Styles**
5. Verify in Figma's Styles panel:
   - 12 Fill Styles appear under a `gradient/` group (page-background, card-oracle, card-upload, card-pink, card-green, card-purple, card-hotpink, card-orange, button-submit, button-nav, button-celestial, divider-line)
   - 24 Effect Styles appear under a `shadow/` group

**Step 3: Visual spot-check**

1. Create a temporary rectangle in Figma
2. Apply the `gradient/page-background` Fill Style -- should show a diagonal pink-to-gold gradient (135deg direction, 5 color stops)
3. Apply the `shadow/card-oracle` Effect Style -- should show a warm brown drop shadow + white inner glow
4. Apply the `shadow/text-logo-full` Effect Style to a text layer -- should show the full 7-layer logo shadow treatment (gold offset + depth + glow + edge definition)
5. Delete the temporary test shapes when done

**Step 4: Manual radial gradients (2 items -- optional, can defer to Phase 5)**

These CANNOT be imported via Tokens Studio. Create manually in Figma if desired now, or defer until the components that use them are built:

1. **Radial Camera Glow** (used on upload card camera circle):
   - Create a circle shape
   - Apply radial gradient fill: center = `rgba(254,243,199,0.5)` (amber-100 at 50% opacity), edge = transparent
   - Stop positions: 0% center, 70% transparent
   - Save as local Fill Style named `gradient/radial-camera-glow` (or note for Phase 5)

2. **OrnateFrame Background** (used in OrnateFrame component -- Phase 4/5 territory):
   - Radial gradient: `#FFFBEB` (amber-50) center to `#FEF3C7` (amber-100) edge
   - This is better created when building the OrnateFrame component in Phase 5

**Step 5: EFFECT-03 confirmation**

The research confirmed that most ambient/glow effects are ALREADY captured as layers within the card and text shadow compositions:
- Gold ambient glow = 3rd layer of `shadow/card-upload`
- Purple refresh glow = 2nd layer of `shadow/card-refresh`
- White inner glow = inner shadow layers in `shadow/card-upload`, `shadow/card-shelter`, `shadow/card-oracle`
- Warm title glow = layer in `shadow/text-logo-full` and `shadow/text-logo-simple`

No additional standalone effect tokens needed for EFFECT-03. The remaining ambient items are:
- A4 (radial camera glow) -- addressed in Step 4 above
- A6 (floral background pattern) -- deferred to Phase 4 (SVG extraction)
- A7 (gold foil overlay) -- a Figma blend mode technique, documented for component building

Confirm: "EFFECT-03 requirements are satisfied -- ambient effects are captured within shadow compositions, radial glow is documented, remaining items deferred to appropriate phases."

  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" after confirming:
1. Tokens Studio imported both files without broken references
2. 12 Fill Styles and 24 Effect Styles exist in Figma
3. Page background gradient looks correct (pink-to-gold diagonal)
4. At least one multi-layer shadow renders correctly

Or describe any issues encountered.</resume-signal>
