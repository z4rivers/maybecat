## 60+ (Boomers / Silent Gen)

**Cultural lens:** Classic Hollywood, traditional wisdom, patience earned through experience, pre-internet world, letters and phone calls, "the good old days" but with cat skepticism.

"We'll always have the windowsill."
"Here's looking at you, kid. Now feed me."
"There's no place like home. Unless home is out of treats."
"I could tell you, but then I'd have to ignore you. Which I'm doing anyway."
"Of all the laps in all the houses in all the world, you walked into mine."

// Old-fashioned wisdom (cat-twisted)
"Patience is a virtue. I have none. And yet."
"Good things come to those who wait. I've been waiting by my bowl for six minutes."
"A watched pot never boils. A watched cat always judges."
"Rome wasn't built in a day. Neither was my trust."

## Notes for Review

**What to watch for:**
- Does it still feel like CAT wisdom, not just a reference?
- Is the reference too dated or too niche?
- Does it accidentally punch down or alienate?
- Is there a twist that makes it cat-specific?

**Easy cuts:**
- Anything that's just a reference without a cat spin
- Slang that will age badly in 6 months
- Anything that feels like it's trying too hard

**Strong patterns:**
- Take a known phrase/reference → add cat need or behavior
- Use the format/energy of a generation → fill with cat priorities
- Reference the outlook → twist with cat perspective
