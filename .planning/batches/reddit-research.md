# Reddit Subreddit Research for MaybeCat Content

## Research Overview

Analyzed 15 Reddit subreddits to understand their core energy, viral dynamics, and translation potential for MaybeCat — a product where a cat answers one-line responses to life questions at 2 AM. Focus: which ones compress well into sharp cat answers vs. which are interesting but require too much setup.

---

## 1. r/MaliciousCompliance (4.3M members)

**Core Energy:** Following the letter while destroying the spirit. Chaotic compliance where technically you did what was asked — but in the worst way possible.

**Viral Post Example:** Boss says "dress more professional" → person shows up in formal wear to move boxes. Property owner told to stop using sidewalk → builds a fence around his entire property line. Employee required to list time-off reasons on public sheet → starts writing medical TMI until told to stop.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "You wanted honesty? Here it is."
- "Sure, I'll help. (Things break.)"
- "You said be myself. You sure about that?"

**MaybeCat Potential: 4/5**
This actually translates well because the cat's one-line answer IS the malicious compliance — the person asked, the cat answered exactly what was asked, and now they have to live with it. High energy, low setup.

---

## 2. r/pettyrevenge (Popular revenge community)

**Core Energy:** Proportional, satisfying payback for small wrongs. The revenge is almost always clever, measured, and perfectly calibrated to the offense.

**Viral Post Example:** Neighbor takes shoveled parking spot → person pours water on their car, which freezes overnight. Woman with shopping cart blocks someone → they surround her car with more carts. Someone occupies reserved train seat → person gets to enjoy the good seat anyway.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "They'll regret that eventually."
- "Patience. Pettiness is a long game."
- "Oh, they'll remember."

**MaybeCat Potential: 3/5**
Moderate translator. The satisfaction is in the story/setup, not the answer. For a one-liner, you lose the delicious detail work that makes revenge feel earned. Works better as context than as cat answer.

---

## 3. r/oddlysatisfying (6.5M members)

**Core Energy:** Visual/tactile pleasure. Symmetry, patterns, repetition, the satisfying behavior of materials, watching things compress or shred or flow perfectly.

**Viral Post Example:** Domino chains, pressure washing, hydraulic presses shredding metal, soap being sliced, paint mixing, stacked snow formations, two kittens sleeping in their bowls.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "That's the stuff."
- "Now do it again."
- "This is what peace looks like."

**MaybeCat Potential: 2/5**
Doesn't compress well. The subreddit IS the content — the visual payoff IS the point. A cat one-liner can't replicate the actual satisfaction. You need to see the pressure wash or the domino chain. A text response about satisfaction feels hollow without the visual anchor. Better as mood/aesthetic reference than actual answer source.

---

## 4. r/mildlyinfuriating (9M+ members)

**Core Energy:** The small wrong thing. Not catastrophe, just enough to get under your skin. Petty annoyances that add up — coworkers blocking parking, someone cutting bulbs off shared garden tulips, trash placement, small inconsiderate acts.

**Viral Post Example:** Coworker fills car with shredded paper as a "harmless prank" (61K upvotes). Someone cuts the bulbs off tulips in a shared garden (12K upvotes). Job applications that are painful, traffic cones in rivers, kitchen disasters from roommates.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "Yeah. That tracks."
- "People are the worst."
- "This is why I'm a cat."
- "And THAT'S why you can't have nice things."

**MaybeCat Potential: 4/5**
Excellent fit. The cat agrees you have a right to be mildly enraged. The one-liner validates the tiny fury. Works perfectly at 2 AM when someone's lying in bed mad about something stupid. High relatability, low friction.

---

## 5. r/technicallythetruth (1.26M members)

**Core Energy:** Correct in the worst way. Information that's factually true but completely defeats the original intent. Pedantic logic taken to absurdist heights. (Often dad-joke energy.)

**Viral Post Example:** "What's the difference between A and B?" → "The letter between them." Someone asks what to do about a problem → "Stop being a problem." Rules followed in the most literal, useless way possible.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "You're not wrong. You're just alone."
- "Technically, yes. Also: no."
- "That's not... but also you're right."

**MaybeCat Potential: 3/5**
Translates okay but feels a bit "try hard." The energy is wry logic, which cats can do, but TTT relies on the person's question being visible/stupid first. Without the setup, it reads like the cat is just being pedantic. Works better as occasional voice than as core strategy.

---

## 6. r/confidentlyincorrect (Large community)

**Core Energy:** Wrong with total certainty. Someone states falsehoods as zinger-level facts. No hedging, no doubt — just confidently incorrect about petroleum origins, basic biology, reality itself.

**Viral Post Example:** Person insists oil doesn't come from decomposed ancient plants/marine life but "forms naturally in Earth's mantle" — with absolute confidence, facts be damned.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "That's definitely not how that works."
- "Cool story. None of it's true."
- "Bold choice. Wrong, but bold."

**MaybeCat Potential: 2/5**
Limited translator. The subreddit's appeal is in the PUBLIC debunking — the comments tearing the wrong answer apart. A cat one-liner can't replicate that back-and-forth. Also, MaybeCat questions are unknowable (no right answer), so this voice doesn't fit the product.

---

## 7. r/ChoosingBeggars (2.5M members)

**Core Energy:** Wanting everything, paying nothing. Entitlement at scale — people beg for free things while demanding specifications, throwing tantrums when they don't get their way, guilting service providers.

**Viral Post Example:** Woman demands free dog-sitting, criticizes the posted rates, tells a fake sick kid story for sympathy, threatens a negative review when refused. Person demands free dog harness be hand-delivered, gets mad it went to someone else first.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "No."
- "You want it free? Then you're not the audience."
- "That's not how bartering works."

**MaybeCat Potential: 3/5**
Moderate. The cat can absolutely shut down entitlement — that's on-brand. But CB stories are long and rely on escalation. A one-liner flattens the absurdity. Works for specific "you're demanding too much" questions but not as a core voice.

---

## 8. r/CatsAreAssholes (666k members)

**Core Energy:** Actual cat behavior documented. Cats being difficult, rude, destructive, indifferent. Real evidence that cats dgaf.

**Viral Post Example:** Cats knocking things, blocking people, destroying furniture, staring with intent to harm, being intentionally difficult.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "That's on you for expecting better."
- "You made the deal when you adopted me."
- "Not my circus."

**MaybeCat Potential: 4/5**
Strong fit IF used carefully. These are actual cat behaviors — MaybeCat is NOT a "cat does cat things" subreddit, it's a cat with opinions. But borrowing the "cats dgaf" energy is gold. The cat answers don't DO things (no behavior), but the ATTITUDE of indifference/being unimpressed is pure cat.

---

## 9. r/OneOrangeBraincell (960k members)

**Core Energy:** Specific cat personality type. Orange cats as collectively sharing one braincell, doing hilariously chaotic/dorky things. Celebration of lovable cat weirdness rather than judgment.

**Viral Post Example:** Orange cat on toilet seat. Orange cat forgets how to use all four legs. Orange cats doing bizarre play patterns, unusual behaviors.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "Have you considered: no thoughts, head empty?"
- "I'm gonna do that again and see what happens."
- "What's happening? Who knows, let's find out."

**MaybeCat Potential: 2/5**
Doesn't translate well. The subreddit celebrates cat behavior ITSELF (the weird thing IS the content). MaybeCat is about a cat's opinions, not cat actions. You lose the joy without the visual. The "one braincell" energy can be borrowed for chaos-endorsing answers, but it's niche and doesn't fit the advice/question-answering core.

---

## 10. r/TooAfraidToAsk (Large community, 10.6K+ readers)

**Core Energy:** Questions underneath questions. Embarrassment, vulnerability, judgment-free space to ask things you couldn't ask out loud. The unspoken stuff.

**Viral Post Example:** "Is it wrong for a dad to relax at the waterpark instead of swimming all day?" Sensitive occupational/ethical questions. Topics people feel uncomfortable discussing elsewhere.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "It's okay to ask. Less okay to tell."
- "You already know the answer. I'm just the witness."
- "Yeah, we're not talking about this."

**MaybeCat Potential: 5/5**
GOLDMINE. This is literally MaybeCat's core energy. A place for the questions people can't ask anywhere else. The cat is the safe/absurd container for the vulnerable thing. 2 AM questions are TFTA questions — "Should I text them?", "Am I wrong to want this?", "Is this insane?" The cat gives permission or honest judgment without the therapist/friend weight. This is the highest-value subreddit for understanding MaybeCat's purpose.

---

## 11. r/cursedcomments (3.2M members)

**Core Energy:** Comments that go too far, perfectly. Dark humor + shock value + smile-inducing inappropriateness. The comment that makes you think "WTF did I just read?" and also laugh.

**Viral Post Example:** Comments so savage, so inappropriate, so unexpectedly honest that they're simultaneously disturbing and hilarious. The mods want you to feel lost AND smile.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "Yeah. And now we don't talk about it."
- "I would say more but the internet has rules."
- "That's the comment I was thinking but wouldn't say."

**MaybeCat Potential: 4/5**
Strong potential. The cat can absolutely deliver the thing that's true but you're not supposed to say. That's THE cat voice — no filter, honest in a way humans can't be. But requires careful calibration (not edgy for edginess sake, but cutting truth). The "cursed" energy — the thing that makes you go "oh no" and laugh — is pure MaybeCat if done right.

---

## 12. r/clevercomebacks (403k members)

**Core Energy:** The reply that wins. Witty responses that beat down a bad argument, a rude person, a stupid statement. The satisfying snap back.

**Viral Post Example:** Wendy's corporate comebacks, people shutting down bad arguments, perfectly timed retorts that end a conversation.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "You walked right into that."
- "Thanks for the setup."
- "That's what you get for asking."

**MaybeCat Potential: 3/5**
Moderate translator. Clever comebacks are good ONE-LINERS but they require the insult/prompt to land. Without knowing what they're responding to, comebacks feel like the cat is just roasting for sport. Works in context, less effective as standalone answers to unknowable questions.

---

## 13. r/AmIOverreacting (4.0M members)

**Core Energy:** Relationship doubt + judgment call. "Is my reaction justified or am I being crazy?" Often featuring texts between partners where someone is being unreasonable and the asker needs validation.

**Viral Post Example:** Husband changes phone PIN before surgery (16K upvotes, 3.3K comments). Dog sitter does their job, dog chews chair (10K upvotes). MIL trying to buy stepson tablet, parents setting boundaries.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "Nope. You're right."
- "Yeah, that's worth being mad about."
- "They're doing it on purpose."
- "You're not overreacting. You're under-responding."

**MaybeCat Potential: 4/5**
Excellent fit. The cat validates or calls you out. 2 AM is when people are wondering "am I losing my mind?" and the cat's answer (yes/no) is grounding. Clear, direct, requires no setup beyond the implicit question. High emotional resonance.

---

## 14. r/EntitledPeople (Quarantined community)

**Core Energy:** Audacity. People doing ridiculous things and expecting the world to accommodate them. The sheer nerve.

**Viral Post Example:** Similar to ChoosingBeggars — entitled sister-in-law stories, people expecting free service, boundary violations treated as reasonable.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "The audacity."
- "And they thought it would work?"
- "That's not how humans work."

**MaybeCat Potential: 3/5**
Moderate. The cat can react with disbelief/judgment to entitlement. But similar to CB — the stories are long and the appeal is in the escalation. A one-liner judgment flattens it. Works for specific questions but not as primary voice.

---

## 15. r/meirl (Me In Real Life)

**Core Energy:** Relatability + absurdism. "This is my life exactly" but also "this is ridiculously specific/weird/stupid." The "wednesday frog" energy — something completely dumb that keeps getting reposted because yes, exactly.

**Viral Post Example:** The "Wednesday frog" (Budgett's frog image posted every Wednesday with "It is Wednesday my dudes"). Instances of collective stupidity done at scale. Awkward/clumsy moments that feel universal.

**How it translates to cat answers:**
- "Yep. That's the energy."
- "This is what I came here for."
- "You get it. Weird people get it."

**MaybeCat Potential: 3/5**
Moderate fit. The meirl energy is almost absurdist comfort — "you're not alone in being strange." The cat can offer that recognition. But requires the weirdness to already be established. Works as tone/mood reference more than as content source.

## RANKING BY MAYBECAT POTENTIAL

### Tier 1 (Gold): 5/5
- **r/TooAfraidToAsk** — Core product match. Vulnerable questions, judgment-free space, the unspoken thing. This is literally what MaybeCat IS.

### Tier 2 (Strong): 4/5
- **r/MaliciousCompliance** — Clean translation. Cat answers ARE the malicious compliance. High energy, low setup.
- **r/mildlyinfuriating** — Perfect 2 AM energy. Validates small fury. High relatability, cat agrees you're right to be mad.
- **r/CatsAreAssholes** — Attitude over behavior. The "cats dgaf" indifference translates to answer voice perfectly.
- **r/cursedcomments** — True but not supposed to be said. Cat has no filter. Requires careful calibration but high impact.
- **r/AmIOverreacting** — Direct validation/judgment. Clear, no setup needed. Answers the implicit question at 2 AM.

### Tier 3 (Moderate): 3/5
- **r/pettyrevenge** — Good energy but loses detail. One-liners flatten the satisfaction.
- **r/technicallythetruth** — Wry logic works but feels try-hard without the setup question.
- **r/ChoosingBeggars** — Cat can shut down entitlement, but long stories don't compress well.
- **r/clevercomebacks** — Good one-liners but need context to land.
- **r/EntitledPeople** — Similar to CB. Audacity is funny but stories are where the value is.
- **r/meirl** — Absurdist comfort works as tone, less as content source.

### Tier 4 (Poor): 2/5
- **r/oddlysatisfying** — Visual medium. Text answers can't replicate the satisfaction. Better as aesthetic reference.
- **r/confidentlyincorrect** — Needs public debunking. Doesn't fit unknowable question format.
- **r/OneOrangeBraincell** — Celebrates behaviors, not opinions. Loses magic without the visual.

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR MAYBECAT CONTENT STRATEGY

### What Actually Translates
1. **Questions underneath questions** — TooAfraidToAsk is the thesis. MaybeCat is a safe container for vulnerable/weird questions. Lean into this hard.

2. **One-liner judgment** — AmIOverreacting and mildlyinfuriating show that people want quick, confident answers at 2 AM. "You're right to be mad" or "No, that's normal" is valuable.

3. **Attitude over story** — MaliciousCompliance works because the answer IS the transaction. Cat says something, person has to live with it. Cursedcomments works for the same reason — it's the truth that's true but shouldn't be said.

4. **Indifference as wisdom** — CatsAreAssholes energy (not caring what humans think) translates perfectly to answers. "Not my problem" is valid advice sometimes.

### What Doesn't Compress
- Subreddits that are visually driven (oddlysatisfying, OneOrangeBraincell) lose all value in text form.
- Subreddits built on escalation/story setup (pettyrevenge, ChoosingBeggars) get flattened by one-liners.
- Subreddits requiring context (clevercomebacks, technicallythetruth) need the setup to land.

### Territory to Mine
- **TooAfraidToAsk** — Deep dive here. What are people actually afraid to ask? Job doubts, relationship fears, weird sexual thoughts, permission to be selfish, health anxiety, existential dread. Each has different cat responses.
- **mildlyinfuriating** — Find the specific petty annoyances that make people rage at 2 AM. Roommate stuff, partner stuff, small injustices.
- **AmIOverreacting** — Relationship decision paralysis. "Should I break up?" / "Am I being crazy?" — cat judges.
- **cursedcomments** — Only use when it's TRUE underneath the edge. A cat saying something real but inappropriate. Not edgy for sport.

### NOT Recommended for Primary Strategy
- Don't over-rely on oddlysatisfying or OneOrangeBraincell energy — those subreddits ARE the visual, can't be translated.
- Don't build responses that need the full story (pettyrevenge, CB) — 2 AM questions are one-line prompts.
- Don't force the "technically true" voice everywhere — it's wry but can sound try-hard.
