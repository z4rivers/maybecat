- **B:** He wrote songs using one keyboard. He wrote more than one thousand songs. Every song sounded the same. Every song was different. He headbutted people as a greeting. He meant it kindly.

**What made him weird:**
- **A:** Every song began with the same keyboard demo, ended with a brand jingle ("Rock over London, rock on Chicago — Wheaties, breakfast of champions"), and was titled exactly what it was about ("I Whupped Batman's Ass").

**How you'd identify him immediately:**
- **A:** Very large man with a keyboard, a permanent headbutt bruise on his forehead, and the widest smile in any room he entered.

**Genre/Era:** Experimental hip hop / astral projection with a beat, 2009-present

**What made them special:**
- **A:** Made hip hop that sounded like it was being broadcast from a dimension adjacent to this one — close enough to recognize, far enough to feel like you were eavesdropping on something private.
- **B:** They made rap music that came from a nearby universe. Not this universe. A different one. Close but different. You could hear both universes at the same time. It was disorienting.

- **A:** Ishmael Butler — formerly of Digable Planets — reinvented himself as a cosmic nomad, releasing music with no interviews, no explanations, and song titles that read like intercepted alien transmissions.
- **B:** The main person used to be in a famous group. He left and started a new group that no one understood. He does not explain the music. The song titles are not in normal language. He does not care if you understand.

**How you'd identify them immediately:**
- **A:** Cloaked in darkness, bathed in projection, making beats that feel like they're happening behind your eyes rather than in your ears.
- **B:** People standing in dark light making sounds that are somewhere between music and a dream you cannot remember.

## 48. DAVID LEE ROTH
**Genre/Era:** Hard rock / Van Halen / spandex philosophy, 1974-present

**What made him special:**
- **A:** High-kicked, split-jumped, and hair-tossed his way through arena rock with the confidence of a man who genuinely believed he was the greatest entertainer alive, which — for the duration of any given performance — he absolutely was.
- **B:** He jumped very high and kicked his legs apart while jumping. He did this in tight pants. He was very confident. His confidence was so large it filled stadiums. This is not a metaphor.

**What made him weird:**
- **A:** Published a 500-page autobiography that read like a fever dream, became an EMT in New York City after leaving Van Halen because he "wanted to help people," and once explained his creative philosophy using a metaphor involving water buffaloes.
- **B:** After being very famous he became an ambulance driver. Because he wanted to. He also wrote a book that was five hundred pages long. About himself. He found the subject interesting enough for five hundred pages.

**How you'd identify him immediately:**
- **A:** Blond mane, spandex, a grin that suggests he's never experienced self-doubt, and legs that scissor-kick with the joy of a man who treats gravity as a suggestion.
- **B:** Blond man in tight pants jumping and smiling. He has never been unsure about anything. This is either inspiring or terrifying.

**The energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** Made narcissism so joyful it became a public service.

## 49. FEVER RAY
**Genre/Era:** Electronic / Karin Dreijer's solo nightmare / post-gender horror pop, 2009-present

**What made her special:**
- **A:** Took the already unsettling sound of The Knife and made it more personal, more intimate, and significantly more likely to make you check the locks on your doors.
- **B:** She made scary music. Not horror movie scary. Scary like when you are alone in a house and something feels wrong but you cannot say what. That kind of scary. With good bass.

**What made her weird:**
- **A:** Performed in full prosthetic makeup that made her look like a creature from a Nordic mythology the Nordics haven't discovered yet, and made music videos where she prowled through suburban spaces like a apex predator loose in IKEA.
- **B:** She wore a fake face on her real face. The fake face was frightening. She walked around furniture stores in the music videos looking like a monster. A stylish monster. The furniture was nice.

**How you'd identify her immediately:**
- **A:** Prosthetic-distorted face, voice pitched to sound like it's being transmitted through ice, and an overall vibe suggesting the concept of "cozy" has been permanently revoked.
- **B:** Person who does not look human. On purpose. Singing in a voice that sounds frozen. You are cold now. From the music. The room temperature has not changed.

**The energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** Made the domestic uncanny and the uncanny domestic.
- **B:** She made normal things frightening and frightening things normal and you could not tell which was which.

**Genre/Era:** Hip hop / Public Enemy / the hype man's hype man, 1985-present

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Wore a clock around his neck the size of a dinner plate and turned the role of "hype man" into a performance art installation, proving that enthusiasm is a legitimate instrument.
- **B:** He wore a big clock. As a necklace. It was a real clock. It worked. His job was to be excited while another person rapped. He was the best in the world at being excited.

**What made him weird:**
- **A:** The clock. Obviously the clock. But also: a reality TV career that outlived his music career, a brief turn as a restaurateur, and a persona so cartoonishly ebullient that it obscured the fact that he's a classically trained pianist who plays fifteen instruments.
- **B:** Everyone thinks he is just a funny man with a clock. He plays fifteen instruments. Fifteen. He went to music school. He can play piano like a classical musician. Nobody talks about this. They talk about the clock.

**How you'd identify him immediately:**
- **A:** Clock. Necklace. Clock necklace. The rest is commentary.
- **B:** Man with clock. Big clock. Around his neck. You cannot miss the clock. It is the size of a plate.

**The energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** Proved that pure uncut joy, properly accessorized, is its own art form.
- **B:** He was happy and loud and wore a clock. It was enough. It was more than enough.

## 51. GENESIS P-ORRIDGE
**Genre/Era:** Industrial / Throbbing Gristle / COUM Transmissions / pandrogyny, 1969-2020

- **A:** Invented industrial music, co-founded two of the most influential underground bands in history, and then surgically modified their body to look like their partner because love was a physical project, not just an emotion.

**What made them weird:**

- **B:** A politician called them a wrecker of civilization. This was meant as an insult. They used it as a compliment. They put it on their resume.

**How you'd identify them immediately:**
- **A:** Surgically altered face, third-eye forehead tattoo, and the calm demeanor of someone who has already transgressed every boundary you're aware of and several you aren't.
- **B:** Person with a changed face and a tattoo of an eye on their forehead. Looking peaceful. They have done things you cannot imagine. They are calm about all of it.

**The energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** Made transgression a spiritual practice and spirituality a transgression.
- **B:** They broke every rule and believed this was a form of prayer. They may have been correct.

- **B:** She built a park. A real park with rides. She also gives books to every child in America. She also paid for medicine that saved lives. She lost a contest to look like herself. She thought this was funny. She was right.

**How you'd identify her immediately:**
- **A:** Blonde wig, rhinestones, and a grin that makes you think you're in on the joke when really you ARE the joke and she's too kind to tell you.
- **B:** Very small woman with very big hair, wearing shiny things. Smiling. The smile looks simple. The woman is not simple. Do not confuse these.

**The energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** Made kindness look like a superpower and big hair look like a crown.
- **B:** She was nice and smart and rich and nobody could figure out how all three fit in one person.

## 53. SLY STONE
**Genre/Era:** Funk / psychedelic soul / brilliant self-destruction, 1966-present

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Built the most integrated, genre-destroying band of the 1960s and made funk, rock, soul, and psychedelia sound like they'd been the same music all along and everyone else had just been filing them in the wrong drawer.
- **B:** His band had men, women, Black people, white people. In the 1960s. Playing music that was all types of music at the same time. This was revolutionary. He was a genius. Then things went badly.

**How you'd identify him immediately:**
- **A:** Whatever decade-inappropriate hairstyle he's currently sporting, enormous sunglasses, and the vibration of a man who changed music and then had music change him back, harder.
- **B:** Man in big sunglasses with unusual hair. He looks like he has seen too much. He has seen too much. The music he made was perfect. Everything else was not.

**The energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** Built a utopia on a bass line and then watched it burn from behind very dark glasses.
- **B:** He created something perfect and then he could not stay inside it.

**Genre/Era:** Synth-pop / Eurythmics / gender as performance art, 1980-present

**What made her special:**
- **A:** Showed up on the pop landscape with a buzz cut and a man's suit and a voice that could melt steel, at a time when female pop stars were contractually obligated to have perms and smile.
- **B:** She cut her hair very short and wore men's clothes in the 1980s. In the 1980s women did not do this. She did it. She also had the best voice. This was difficult to argue with.

**What made her weird:**
- **A:** Performed at the Grammys in drag as Elvis Presley, shaved her head when long hair was the uniform, and maintained an androgynous presentation so committed that interviewers couldn't stop asking about gender instead of music.

- **A:** Cropped hair, sharp suit, and a voice that descends from somewhere between a cathedral ceiling and a broken heart.

**The energy in one sentence:**

- **B:** She looked like a businessman and sang like an angel and nobody knew what to do about this.

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Rapped with a stream-of-consciousness intensity that made every verse sound like a man narrating his life in real time while the life was happening too fast to edit, draped in robes and Versace like a don who couldn't decide between the corner and the runway.
- **B:** He rapped very fast about many things. The things did not always connect. He wore a bathrobe and expensive Italian clothes. At the same time. He made this work. Nobody else could make this work.

**What made him weird:**
- **A:** Wore a mask for early Wu-Tang appearances (before MF DOOM made it iconic), recorded an album entirely about cooking (Supreme Clientele), and named himself after a character from a 1979 kung fu movie because hip hop and martial arts cinema are the same mythology if you squint right.
- **B:** His name is from a karate movie. He wore a mask. Then he stopped wearing the mask. He also talks about cooking. And crime. And Italian fashion. In the same sentence.

**How you'd identify him immediately:**
- **A:** Wallabee Clarks, a bathrobe that costs more than your rent, and a delivery so rapid-fire it sounds like his thoughts are in a foot race and his mouth is trying to keep up.

- **B:** He was elegant and chaotic and you could not have one without the other.

- **B:** She wants to go to Mars. She thinks AI will make art. She named her child something a computer would say. She lives like science fiction is already happening. She may be correct.

**How you'd identify her immediately:**
- **A:** Silver hair, elf ears (sometimes surgically implied), and the aesthetic of someone who is cosplaying as a character from a future that hasn't decided if it's utopian or dystopian yet.
- **B:** Woman with strange hair and possibly pointed ears. She looks like she is from the future. She thinks she is from the future. She may just be from Canada.

- **A:** Made the apocalypse sound like a love song and love sound like a software update.
- **B:** She lived in the future and sent music back to the present. The present was confused.

**The energy in one sentence:**

**Genre/Era:** Hip hop / house / verbal arson, 2011-present

## 59. LEE "SCRATCH" PERRY
**Genre/Era:** Reggae / dub / sonic sorcerer, 1960s-2021

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Invented dub by treating the mixing board like a musical instrument from another planet, creating echo-drenched soundscapes in a tiny Jamaican studio he'd covered floor-to-ceiling in found objects, album covers, and what appeared to be prayers.
- **B:** He invented a type of music by using the machines wrong. On purpose. He put echoes on everything. He covered his studio with pictures and objects and words. The studio was a work of art. Then he burned it down.

**What made him weird:**
- **A:** Burned down his own studio — the legendary Black Ark — because he said there were demons in it, glued album covers and mirrors to every surface of subsequent studios, and gave interviews in a stream-of-consciousness glossolalia that was either channeling spirits or the most advanced form of trolling ever devised.
- **B:** He set fire to his own workplace because of demons. He built a new one and covered it with mirrors. He spoke in a way that might be a language from another world. Or he might be joking. He has never clarified.

**How you'd identify him immediately:**
- **A:** Covered in mirrors, stickers, and inscrutable talismans, speaking in a language that's adjacent to English but has its own grammar and gravitational pull.

- **B:** He made rap music using broken sounds and screaming. He grew up on the internet. The bad parts of the internet. He put the feelings from the bad internet into music. The music was angry and clever and sometimes very funny.

**What made him weird:**
- **A:** Named albums things search engines couldn't process, performed for sometimes hostile audiences in the DIY scene while stationed as a military contractor, and made music that deliberately sounds like it's buffering, glitching, and fighting with itself.
- **B:** His album names do not work in Google. He did this on purpose. He was in the military and also an underground musician. These are not usually the same person. His music sounds like a computer that is broken. It is not broken. It just sounds that way.

**How you'd identify him immediately:**
- **A:** Shirtless, drenched in sweat, screaming into a laptop with the energy of a man who just won an argument with the entire internet and isn't done yet.
- **B:** Man without a shirt, very sweaty, yelling at a computer. The computer is playing music. He is also the music. The audience does not know if they should dance or be afraid. They do both.

- **B:** He turned online anger into music and the music was better than the anger.
