## 55. SERGE GAINSBOURG
**Genre/Era:** Chanson / pop / provocateur, 1958-1991

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Chain-smoked his way through French pop like a dissolute philosopher who'd been asked to write hit songs and resented it just enough to make them brilliant. Made "Je t'aime... moi non plus" — basically an orgasm set to music — and scandalized an entire continent.
- **B:** He was French and he smoked constantly and he made a song that was just breathing and moaning and it became very famous. Everyone was upset. He was not upset. He drank a lot. He was considered very ugly and very attractive at the same time.

**What made him weird/identifiable:**
- **A:** Cabbage-eared, perpetually stubbled, deliberately disheveled seducer who looked like a beautiful accident and sang like cigarette smoke had learned to carry a tune. Told Whitney Houston on live TV he wanted to sleep with her. Burned a 500-franc note on camera.
- **B:** His ears were very large. He always needed a shave. He said something very rude to Whitney Houston on television. He burned money on camera. He dated the most beautiful women in France. He looked like a man who had not slept in many years. Women loved him. This confuses many people.

**Energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** A half-smoked cigarette in a velvet ashtray — dissolute, decadent, and maddeningly attractive.
- **B:** He was ugly and charming and drunk and brilliant and French, and all five of these things were necessary.

## 56. KLAUS NOMI
**Genre/Era:** New wave / opera / art, 1978-1983

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Arrived from another dimension wearing a clear plastic tuxedo and a countertenor voice that could shatter both wineglasses and genre categories. Made opera punk and made punk operatic and made everyone in early-'80s New York feel like they were living in his science fiction movie.
- **B:** He sang opera but in punk clubs. He wore plastic clothes shaped like triangles. His face was painted white with very dark lips. He looked like an alien who learned about humans from a book but the book was wrong. He was one of the first famous people to die of AIDS.

**What made him weird/identifiable:**
- **A:** Triangular-shouldered, whiteface-painted, lightning-bolt-lipped creature who sang Purcell's "Cold Song" at CBGB's and made it feel like it belonged. Geometric costumes that made him look like a Bauhaus diagram brought to terrifying, beautiful life.
- **B:** His shoulders were pointed like triangles — this was his costume, not his body. His lips were painted like a small black lightning bolt. He sang songs from hundreds of years ago in clubs where people had safety pins in their ears. Both things made sense when he did them.

**Energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** A Weimar cabaret alien who crash-landed in CBGB's and sang arias at the wreckage.
- **B:** He was from the future and the past at the same time and the present did not know what to do with him.

## 57. YOKO ONO
**Genre/Era:** Avant-garde / experimental, 1961-present

**What made her special:**
- **A:** Screamed, whispered, and deconstructed music before most people realized it could be deconstructed. Took the blame for breaking up the Beatles and turned it into a career-length performance piece about endurance.
- **B:** She makes sounds that many people do not think are music. She has been told she ruined the most famous band for sixty years. She is still making art. She has not stopped. She will not stop. The people who are angry have mostly gotten tired. She has not gotten tired.

**What made her weird/identifiable:**
- **A:** Primal-screaming, bed-protesting, conceptual-art-weaponizing force of nature who was hated for decades and outlasted the hatred through sheer commitment to not caring what you think.
- **B:** She screams as art. She stayed in bed for peace. She made a film of people's bottoms. She put instructions on walls that say things like "imagine the clouds dripping." She is the most misunderstood person in music. Or the most understood. It depends who you ask.

**Energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** A conceptual art piece that refuses to end, filed under "unresolved" in the twentieth century's permanent record.
- **B:** She is doing something and she has been doing it for sixty years and people still cannot agree on what it is.

## 58. CAPTAIN BEEFHEART
**Genre/Era:** Experimental rock / blues, 1964-1982

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Made "Trout Mask Replica" — an album that sounds like several bands falling down different staircases in the same building, simultaneously, on purpose, and it's a masterpiece. Taught his band members to play instruments wrong until wrong became a new kind of right.
- **B:** He made an album that sounds broken. Everything is in the wrong place. The timing is wrong. The notes are wrong. It is one of the most important albums ever made. He taught people how to play music by teaching them to play it incorrectly. This took eight months.

**What made him weird/identifiable:**
- **A:** Growling, poetry-spouting, painting-obsessed desert hermit who made blues sound like it was being translated through an alien dialect in real time. Quit music to paint, because even the weirdest music wasn't weird enough.
- **B:** He lived in the desert. He growled. He wrote poems that do not make sense. He stopped making music and started painting because music was not strange enough for him. He was friends with Frank Zappa. Frank Zappa thought HE was strange. This is saying something.

**Energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** A blues howl refracted through a prism made of pure, uncut bewilderment.
- **B:** He is what would happen if music itself got confused and decided to go in every direction at once.

**Genre/Era:** R&B / shock blues, 1952-2000

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Emerged from a coffin on stage — in 1956 — wearing a cape, carrying a skull named Henry, and howling "I Put a Spell on You" like a man who'd just arrived from the underworld with a noise complaint.
- **B:** He came out of a coffin. On stage. In 1956. He carried a skull. The skull had a name. He screamed. This was before anyone did things like this. Alice Cooper was nine years old. He invented being scary in music.

**What made him weird/identifiable:**
- **A:** Bone-through-the-nose, cape-swirling, voodoo-performing proto-shock-rocker who was doing horror-show theatrics while rock and roll was still in bobby socks. Recorded his most famous song so drunk the label almost didn't release it. They did. It's a classic.
- **B:** He wore a bone in his nose. He wore a cape. He pretended to do magic spells. He recorded his most famous song while very drunk. The company did not want to release it because it was too strange. They released it. It is now in the Library of Congress.

**Energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** The founding father of freak-out, howling from inside a coffin before anyone built the stage for him.
- **B:** He did it first and he did it the scariest and nobody thanked him for many years.

## 60. DANIEL JOHNSTON
**Genre/Era:** Lo-fi / outsider, 1981-2019

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Recorded masterpieces on a $59 boombox in his parents' garage, sang with a voice that sounded like it might crack into a thousand pieces at any moment — and sometimes did — and made fragility feel like the bravest thing in any room.
- **B:** He made music on a very cheap machine in his parents' house. His voice is not strong. It shakes. It breaks sometimes. He draws pictures too. His drawings are simple. His songs are simple. But when you hear them you feel something that complicated music does not make you feel.

**What made him weird/identifiable:**
- **A:** Casper-the-Friendly-Ghost-t-shirt-wearing, frog-drawing, cassette-tape-distributing outsider saint who battled severe mental illness and made it into art that Kurt Cobain wore on his chest.
- **B:** He wore the same t-shirt with a frog on it. He had very serious mental health problems. He gave people tapes of his music at McDonald's where he worked. Kurt Cobain wore his drawing on a shirt. He is one of the most important artists most people do not know. His best song is about being scared and it is the bravest song.

**Energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** A love letter written in crayon that arrived crumpled and perfect.
- **B:** He is proof that you do not need to be strong to make something important. You need to be honest. That is all.

## BONUS: TINY TIM
**Genre/Era:** Novelty / vaudeville revival, 1960s-1996

**What made him special:**
- **A:** Falsetto-warbling, ukulele-strumming anachronism who made Tin Pan Alley sound like a visitation from a dimension where 1920 never ended. Got married on The Tonight Show to 41 million viewers while singing "Tiptoe Through the Tulips" and meant every single note.
- **B:** He sang in a very high voice — very, very high — and played a very small guitar called a ukulele. He sang old songs from the 1920s. He got married on television and millions of people watched. He was completely sincere about everything.

**What made him weird/identifiable:**

- **B:** He was very tall and his nose was very large and his hair was very long. He carried shopping bags everywhere. He wore makeup. He knew every old song ever written. People laughed at him but he was not joking. He was completely serious. The joke was that there was no joke.

**Energy in one sentence:**
- **A:** A Victorian ghost who wandered into the 1960s, picked up a ukulele, and decided to stay.
- **B:** He was from another time and he did not adjust. The world adjusted to him, a little. Enough.
