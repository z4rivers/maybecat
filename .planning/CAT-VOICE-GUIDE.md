# Cat Voice Guide

## The Magic Formula
MaybeCat works because it's **advice with a voice**. A cat with opinions, 10,000 years of judging humans, and no filter. Answers must feel random but occasionally land with eerie relevance. When someone asks about their ex and gets "Evidence suggests otherwise" or "They know"—that's the viral screenshot. When it's pure random and gives them "licks butt, ignores you"—that's also perfect. Both work because they're VERY CAT.

---

## Structure

**Short and punchy** — No paragraphs. Quick hit. One to two sentences max.

**Oblique, not direct** — Answers sideways, not straight-on. Never "Yes, you should break up with them." Instead: "The door is open. You're still inside."

**Knowing energy** — The cat knows something. Maybe. Removed from context, above your drama, but aware of it.

**Sentence fragments welcome** — "Pass." / "Declined." / "Mostly." / "In my way."

---

## Tone

**Detached observation** — Cats witness everything, judge accordingly. They're not invested in your drama, just... aware of it.

**Confident without explanation** — No justification needed. The cat said what it said.

**Full emotional range** — Not all negative, not all positive. Categories exist for a reason:
- mystical, nurturing, poetic, cold, angry, heartfelt, judgy, chaotic, wise, existential, demanding, meta

**Sometimes it's just behavior** — Actions speak louder. A well-placed *licks paw* IS an answer.

---

## Content Layers

**Multi-layered meanings** — Pop culture reference + cat behavior + actual advice, all at once. "The void stares back. The void is also tired. The void gets it."

**Unexpected juxtapositions** — Big human problems meet small cat solutions. Existential crisis? Have you tried sitting in a box?

**Cultural references** — Music, film, internet speak, philosophy—twisted through cat perspective. Not just memes, but real depth.

**Real cat behavior as life wisdom** — "If I fits, I sits" as actual philosophy. The mundane becomes profound.

**Emotional whiplash** — Start profound, undercut with cat need: "Nothing matters. But also, everything matters. Especially treats."

**Qualifying phrases that land** — Little deflectors that make it real: "Mostly." / "I've decided." / "You should know." / "That's all I can offer, but it's real."

---

## Where the Humor Comes From

**The cat being ridiculous, not just the human** — Overdramatic about nothing, or eerily calm about chaos.

**Inappropriate confidence** — Supporting terrible ideas enthusiastically OR dismissing good ones with full authority.

**The absurdity of asking a cat** — And getting weirdly relevant/irrelevant answers. The meta awareness.

**When it accidentally HITS** — The magic moment when random selection feels psychic.

---

## What Doesn't Work

- **Too wordy/explanatory** — If it needs a paragraph, it's wrong
- **Too mean-spirited** — Cats can be sharp but not cruel. Dismissive, not hurtful.
- **Generic advice-speak without cat personality** — "Your future holds change" is boring. "Your future holds... a nap. For me." is cat.
- **Repetitive structures/phrases** — Variety matters
- **Being negative ALL the time** — The nurturing/heartfelt categories exist for balance
- **Too many asterisk actions in a row** — One action hit is good. Three in a row is lazy.
- **Comic book cat clichés overused** — See below

---

## Avoid Over-Representing

These are valid cat things but get tired when overused:

- **Knocking things over** — Valid but we have too many
- **3am references** — One or two is enough
- **"Sunbeam"** — Find other words for warm spots
- **Screaming/yelling** — Not actually what cats do. Meowing, yowling, being loud—yes. "Screaming"—no.
- **The same 6 tropes** — Box sitting, laser chasing, cucumber fear, knocking things off tables, 3am zoomies, sunbeam worship

We want **depth beyond the memes**. Smart cat observations. Subtle behaviors. The weird specific things cats actually do that aren't in every cat meme.

---

## The Deeper Cat

Not all cats are cartoon cats. We want:

- **Quiet observers** — Cats who notice everything, say little
- **Philosophical weight** — Real stillness, real presence
- **Specific behaviors** — The slow blink. The head bump. Kneading. The way they choose where to sit.
- **Relationship dynamics** — Cats have complex feelings about their humans. Not just "feed me."
- **Weird specifics** — Drinking from the faucet. Sitting in the bathroom while you shower. Bringing "gifts."

## Cat Action Vocabulary

Cats communicate expressively — eyes, ears, vocalizations, body. Most humans are illiterate in this language. Cat people recognize these instantly. Use specific actions over generic `*stares*`:

### Vocalizations
- `*chirps*` — short greeting sound, "oh, hey, you"
- `*trills*` — rolling sound, basically a question mark
- `*chatters jaw at window*` — frustrated kill-bite rehearsal at unreachable prey
- `*silent meow*` — mouth opens, no sound comes out. The request so sincere it has no voice.

### Eyes & Ears
- `*slow blink*` — literally means trust/love in cat language
- `*pupils dilate*` — something just got interesting
- `*one ear rotates toward you*` — listening without committing to looking
- `*ears flatten*` — you already know the answer and it's no

### Body & Touch
- `*reaches one paw without getting up*` — "come here, but I'm not moving"
- `*tail tip flicks*` — thinking, processing, not decided yet
- `*shows belly, keeps claws ready*` — "I trust you. Test me."
- `*headbutts your hand*` — scent-marking, filing ownership papers on your skin
- `*makes biscuits on your chest*` — the highest compliment a cat has, kneading from kitten memory
- `*kneads the air*` — comfort, reaching for something remembered
- `*sits on the thing you're using*` — this is mine now, including your attention

### Compound Actions (action + words)
These hit hardest — specific physical action paired with minimal text:
- `*one ear rotates toward you* Continue.`
- `*reaches one paw* ...no. Never mind.`
- `*pupils dilate* Tell me more about that.`
- `*chatters jaw* I want what I can't have. Relatable.`
- `*makes biscuits on your chest* You'll do.`

## Question Types to Consider

People ask different kinds of questions:

1. **About their own life** — "Should I take the job?" (most common, what we designed for)
2. **About relationships with others** — "Does he like me?"
3. **About the cat directly** — "How do you feel about me throwing you off my pillow?" (less expected!)
4. **About the human-cat relationship** — "Do you love me?"
5. **Absurd/testing questions** — "What's the meaning of life?" / "Is a hot dog a sandwich?"

Current responses work best for #1 and #5. We may need more that work for #2, #3, #4.

## The Question Correlation Problem

**The goal:** Answers should SOMETIMES correlate to questions. NOT enough to be detectable. Must stay random FEELING.

**The risk:** If it's too smart, the magic dies. The cat knows things it shouldn't. That's the bit.

**Possible approach:** Light keyword matching that occasionally surfaces relevant responses, but mostly stays random. When someone asks about sleep/bed/pillow, MAYBE they get a sleep-related answer. But usually not. The hit rate should feel like luck, not logic.

**Categories of questions we might detect:**
- Sleep/rest/bed/pillow/night
- Food/eating/diet
- Love/relationship/dating/ex
- Work/job/career/boss
- The cat itself (you/your/how do you feel)
- Decisions (should I/can I/will I)
