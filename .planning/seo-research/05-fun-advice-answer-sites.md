# SEO Research: Fun Advice & Answer Sites
*Research date: 2026-02-09*

## Key Finding
The entire "ask a question, get an answer" space is either soulless utilities (wheels, buttons) or earnest/dry (I Ching, quote generators). NOBODY occupies the middle ground between "just a tool" and "just a joke." The only sites with real audiences have a distinctive voice (Co-Star, Ask a Manager, InspiroBot).

## The Biggies by Traffic
| Site | Monthly Traffic | What It Is | Has Voice? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Co-Star | 20M+ downloads, $800K/mo | Sassy astrology app | YES — provocative, biting |
| Ask a Manager | 3.86M-19.55M | Workplace advice blog | YES — one voice IS the brand |
| Daily Stoic | 1.4M | Stoic wisdom / Ryan Holiday | Yes — curated with personality |
| Picker Wheel | 2-5.85M | Spin a wheel | None |
| Wheel Decide | 1.85M | Custom decision wheels | None |
| FlipSimu | 737K-983K | Coin flip + tools | None |
| Magic 8-Ball | 402K | Classic 20 answers | Nostalgic, no real voice |
| Just Flip a Coin | 366K | Coin flip | None |
| I Ching Online | 67-76K | Ancient hexagram readings | Scholarly/dry |
| InspiroBot | 46-61K | Satirical AI quote generator | YES — went viral 2017 |
| Advice Slip | 46K (10M+ API/yr) | Random advice snippets | None |

## The Five Dead Zones
1. **Soulless Utilities** — Wheels, buttons, coin flips. Massive traffic, zero personality.
2. **Fortune Cookie Dispensers** — Advice Slip, random generators. Interchangeable.
3. **Binary Answerers** — Yes/no oracles, 8-balls. 20 canned responses.
4. **Earnest Wisdom** — I Ching, Stoic quotes, compliment generators. No edge.
5. **Pure Gimmick** — Bad advice generators. Funny once, never return.

## The Goldmine: VOICE
Every site that built a real audience has a distinctive personality:
- **Co-Star** — Sassy push notifications. 20M downloads. Quarter of US women 18-25.
- **Ask a Manager** — One person's voice = 3.86M/month.
- **InspiroBot** — Satirical AI persona. Went viral. 146K Facebook shares.
- **Daily Stoic** — Ryan Holiday's curation. 1.4M/month, 320K email subs, 3M Instagram.
- **Wisdom of Chopra** — Parody quote generator. 146K Facebook shares.

## The Gap MaybeCat Fills
| What Exists | Voice? | Curated? | Shareable? | Cat? | Fun? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Magic 8 Ball | No | 20 canned | No | No | Mild |
| I Ching | No | Ancient text | No | No | No |

## Search Terms People Use
### High volume, nobody fun owns them:
- "should I [text them / quit / go out]"
- "what should I do"
- "help me decide"
- "give me advice" / "I need advice"
- "random advice" / "fun advice website"

## Critical Insight
The advice-with-voice space dwarfs the oracle space:
- Oracle ceiling: 402K/month (Magic 8-Ball)
- Voice ceiling: 20M+ downloads (Co-Star), 3.86M/month (Ask a Manager)
- The voice IS the product, not the format
