# MaybeCat SEO Strategy
*Established: 2026-02-09, Updated: 2026-02-09*

## Positioning

**MaybeCat owns the question moment.**

Not the answer. Not the advice. The impulse to ask.

- Should I do it? Ask MaybeCat.
- What should I do? Ask MaybeCat.
- Is this a bad idea? Ask MaybeCat.
- What's the worst that could happen? Ask MaybeCat.
- Am I overthinking this? Ask MaybeCat.
- Is it worth it? Ask MaybeCat.
- Will it work out? Ask MaybeCat.

Anytime someone has a question and wants someone to just tell them — that's the moment.

### What MaybeCat Is
A cat with opinions. Real adoptable shelter cats that answer your questions. 800+ responses. The cat has been judging humans for 10,000 years. The only hedge is "maybe."

### What MaybeCat Is NOT
- An oracle / fortune teller / mystical anything
- A serious advice site
- An astrology app
- A generic random generator
- Fun (don't say it — show it)

### The Rule
**Demonstrate, never claim.** Never call ourselves "funny" or "sassy" or "fun" — the voice does that work or it doesn't.

### The Cat's Authority
The cat is the expert — at being a cat. Highly qualified — at being a cat. The only hedge is "maybe" — maybe the cat will answer, maybe not. The cat doesn't apologize for its authority.

## The Competitive Landscape

### The empty slot
No site on the internet combines: ask anything + sharp answers with a distinctive voice + a character who IS the experience + built for screenshots.

### What exists (and what's missing from each)

| Category | Examples | Traffic | What They Have | What They're Missing |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Decision wheels | Picker Wheel, Wheel of Names | 4-19M/mo | Massive audience, suspense animation | Zero personality, zero voice |
| Coin flips | flipsimu, justflipacoin | 370K-737K/mo | Simple, satisfying | Binary only, no character |
| Magic 8-Ball | magic-8ball.com | 402K/mo | Recognizable format | 20 stale answers from 1946 |
| Yes/No + GIFs | yesno.wtf | small | Right instinct (response IS product) | No character, no voice |
| Voice-driven | Co-Star | 30M+ users | Voice IS product, screenshot-native | Astrology-locked, push-only, can't ask it things |
| Character chat | Character.AI | 180M/mo web | People WANT characters | Conversational, not oracle-format |
| Serious advice | Ask a Manager, articles | millions/mo | Depth, SEO authority | Zero entertainment, 2000 words when you want 2 seconds |
| Quizzes | BuzzFeed, ProProfs | varies | Engagement, shareability | Slow (8-12 clicks), no character, generic platforms |

### The gap
A character-driven answer to questions that's built for screenshots. That slot is empty.

### Closest parallels (what to learn from each)
- **Co-Star's growth model:** Voice + screenshot detection + share prompting = viral engine
- **Akinator:** Wrapping an algorithm in a character creates an entirely different product
- **yesno.wtf:** The response format matters more than accuracy
- **WTF Should I Make for Dinner:** Voice alone turned a single-serving site into a brand (cookbook deal)
- **BuzzFeed quizzes:** 75% of traffic from social shares — the result must be screenshot-worthy
- **Picker Wheel:** The suspense animation matters (MaybeCat's "thinking" delay = this)

## The "Question Impulse" Opportunity

### Search volume (US monthly estimates)

| Query Pattern | Est. Searches | Current Results |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| "should I text my ex" | 50K - 150K | 100% serious articles |
| "should I quit my job" | 50K - 100K | 100% serious articles |
| "should I text him/her" | 40K - 100K | Articles + quizzes |
| "what should I do" | 100K+ | Self-help + decision tools |
| "should I break up" | 30K - 80K | 100% serious articles |
| "help me decide" | 20K - 50K | Decision tools + articles |
| "is this a bad idea" | varies | Articles + TikTok |
| "is it worth it" | varies | Review sites + articles |
| "am I overthinking this" | varies | Mental health articles |

Aggregate "question impulse" long-tail: **millions per month**

### The psychology
- Most searchers already know what they want to do — looking for permission, not advice
- The act of asking IS the decision-making process
- A coin flip reveals what you actually want by how you feel about the result
- MaybeCat's responses do this at a deeper level — a layered answer gives you more to react to

### Decision fatigue tailwind
- Lightweight decision-tools are a documented growing trend (Android Headlines, Sept 2025)
- People want to "delegate decisions to chance or curated systems"
- Google is eating the utility layer (built-in coin flip) but can never have a character with attitude

## The Void With Voice

### The Opportunity
People ask questions into the void — Google, Reddit, 3 AM searches — and get 2,000-word articles, therapy-speak, or 47 Reddit comments when they need one sharp line. MaybeCat is the destination for those questions.

### 7 Void Categories
1. **Decision Paralysis** ("Should I...") — need permission, not pro/con lists
2. **Self-Doubt** ("Am I...") — need someone to say "you're okay," not clinical definitions
3. **Relationship Anxiety** ("Does he/she...") — #1 void category, pattern-matching for certainty
4. **Health Anxiety** ("Do I have...") — where searching makes it worse
5. **Existential** ("What's the point...") — 3 AM spirals that need something fast
6. **Permission-Seeking** ("Is it okay to...") — shame underneath, Google can't address it
7. **Hope/Future** ("Will I ever...") — motivation articles are both true and useless in crisis

### The 2-4 AM Window
Peak search time for these questions. Mean peak at 2:25 AM. Midnight brains need one sharp line, not a researched article. MaybeCat is built for this moment.

### Content Scaling Path
800 → 10,000 responses via handcrafted (~2K) + templates (~5K) + question-bucketed (~3K). Quality over quantity — curated, not AI jibberish. See `10-content-scaling-strategy.md`.

### Question Mining Sources
Reddit (r/AmItheAsshole, r/relationships, r/advice, r/NoStupidQuestions, r/TooAfraidToAsk), Quora, AnswerThePublic, AlsoAsked, Google autocomplete. Full research in `09-void-questions.md`.
