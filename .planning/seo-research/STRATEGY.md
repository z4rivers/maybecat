# MaybeCat SEO Strategy
*Established: 2026-02-09, Updated: 2026-02-09*

## Positioning

**MaybeCat owns the question moment.**

Not the answer. Not the advice. The impulse to ask.

- Should I do it? Ask MaybeCat.
- What should I do? Ask MaybeCat.
- Is this a bad idea? Ask MaybeCat.
- What's the worst that could happen? Ask MaybeCat.
- Am I overthinking this? Ask MaybeCat.
- Is it worth it? Ask MaybeCat.
- Will it work out? Ask MaybeCat.

Anytime someone has a question and wants someone to just tell them — that's the moment.

### What MaybeCat Is
A cat with opinions. Real adoptable shelter cats that answer your questions. 800+ responses. The cat has been judging humans for 10,000 years. The only hedge is "maybe."

### What MaybeCat Is NOT
- An oracle / fortune teller / mystical anything
- A serious advice site
- An astrology app
- A generic random generator
- Fun (don't say it — show it)

### The Rule
**Demonstrate, never claim.** Never call ourselves "funny" or "sassy" or "fun" — the voice does that work or it doesn't.

### The Cat's Authority
The cat is the expert — at being a cat. Highly qualified — at being a cat. The only hedge is "maybe" — maybe the cat will answer, maybe not. The cat doesn't apologize for its authority.

## The Competitive Landscape

### The empty slot
No site on the internet combines: ask anything + sharp answers with a distinctive voice + a character who IS the experience + built for screenshots.

### What exists (and what's missing from each)

| Category | Examples | Traffic | What They Have | What They're Missing |
|----------|---------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| Decision wheels | Picker Wheel, Wheel of Names | 4-19M/mo | Massive audience, suspense animation | Zero personality, zero voice |
| Coin flips | flipsimu, justflipacoin | 370K-737K/mo | Simple, satisfying | Binary only, no character |
| Magic 8-Ball | magic-8ball.com | 402K/mo | Recognizable format | 20 stale answers from 1946 |
| Yes/No + GIFs | yesno.wtf | small | Right instinct (response IS product) | No character, no voice |
| Voice-driven | Co-Star | 30M+ users | Voice IS product, screenshot-native | Astrology-locked, push-only, can't ask it things |
| AI companions | Replika, Character.AI, Chai, Pi | $120M+ rev, 180M/mo (C.AI) | People WANT characters, high retention | Conversational (long), sycophantic, no brevity |
| AI therapists | ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Woebot | 48.7% of MH users use LLMs | Intelligent, available 24/7 | Paragraphs when you need 1 line, validates too much |
| Astrology Q&A | Co-Star "The Void", Astrology.com | Co-Star: 30M+ users | Character-driven answers to questions | Astrology-locked, paywall, need birth chart |
| Serious advice | Ask a Manager, articles | millions/mo | Depth, SEO authority | Zero entertainment, 2000 words when you want 2 seconds |
| Q&A platforms | Reddit, Quora (Yahoo Answers dead 2021) | massive | Community, depth, real humans | 47 comments when you need 1 line, slow |
| Quizzes | BuzzFeed, ProProfs | varies | Engagement, shareability | Slow (8-12 clicks), no character, generic platforms |

### The gap
A character-driven answer to questions that's built for screenshots. That slot is empty.

### The AI Companion & Therapy Boom (added 2026-02-11)

The biggest new competitor category since our Feb 9 research. Not just ChatGPT — the entire AI companion/therapy space:

**Market size:** AI companion market $37B in 2025, projected $552B by 2035. AI mental health segment: $2B in 2026, growing 34.3% annually.

**Who's in it:**
- **ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini** — general LLMs people use as therapists. 48.7% of people with MH challenges use LLMs for support. 73% for anxiety, 63% for personal advice. ~50% of Gen Z uses AI for dating advice.
- **Replika** — 25M users, $24-30M revenue. Dedicated AI companion.
- **Character.AI** — 20M MAU, 180M monthly web visits. Chat with AI characters.
- **Chai** — $30M+ ARR with 12 employees. AI character chat.
- **Pi (Inflection)** — conversational AI focused on being a supportive friend.
- **Woebot, Wysa** — dedicated AI therapy apps.
- **Snapchat My AI** — 150M users. Built into social platform.
- **72% of US teens** have tried an AI companion (2025).

**Their shared weakness — MaybeCat's angle:**
1. **Sycophantic** — LLMs agree too much, validate too much, hedge everything. The cat doesn't validate.
2. **Verbose** — paragraphs when you need 6 words. MaybeCat: 1-2 sentences, always.
3. **No character** — ChatGPT is helpful but has no PERSONALITY. No attitude, no edge, no voice.
4. **No shareability** — nobody screenshots ChatGPT therapy. MaybeCat is built for the screenshot.
5. **Exhausting** — AI companions want ongoing conversation. MaybeCat: ask, get answer, done.

**What this means for MaybeCat:**
MaybeCat is NOT competing with any of these. Not on depth, not on conversation, not on therapy. MaybeCat is not a chat-with-a-cat. It's not an AI companion. It's not trying to be a therapist.

MaybeCat is **a place for questions.** You ask, you get one line, you're done. No back-and-forth, no relationship, no ongoing thread. The question is the moment — the cat just happens to be there when it arrives.

The AI companion boom is CONTEXT, not competition. It proves people are desperate to ask something and hear something back. But all those tools turned it into a conversation. MaybeCat is the opposite: one moment, one line, move on with your life.

### Co-Star's "The Void" — Closest Competitor (added 2026-02-11)

Co-Star launched "The Void" in July 2023 — users ask questions and receive character-driven answers. This is the closest existing product to MaybeCat's model.

**How it works:**
- 5 categories: Self, Love, Expression, Social, Work
- ~100 curated questions to choose from
- Answers based on natal chart + ChatGPT + astrological database
- Physical pop-ups with "Soviet computer" in NYC/LA (printed answers on receipt paper)

**Where MaybeCat wins:**
- No birth chart required — instant, zero signup
- Free (The Void is behind Co-Star's paywall)
- 2,150+ responses vs ~100 curated questions
- ASK anything vs choose from a list
- 31 distinct cat personalities vs one astrological voice
- Built for screenshot/share (Co-Star's Void answers aren't as shareable)

### Google AI Overviews (added 2026-02-11)

Google now uses Gemini to answer personal questions via AI Overviews and AI Mode. But:
- Institutional, hedged, disclaimer-heavy
- Can't have a personality or an opinion
- Tries to be helpful, not honest
- Google is eating the utility layer (built-in coin flip, calculator) but can NEVER be a character with attitude

### Closest parallels (what to learn from each)
- **Co-Star's growth model:** Voice + screenshot detection + share prompting = viral engine
- **Co-Star's Void:** Ask questions → character-driven answers. Proves demand. But astrology-locked + paywall = opportunity for MaybeCat.
- **Akinator:** Wrapping an algorithm in a character creates an entirely different product
- **yesno.wtf:** The response format matters more than accuracy
- **WTF Should I Make for Dinner:** Voice alone turned a single-serving site into a brand (cookbook deal)
- **BuzzFeed quizzes:** 75% of traffic from social shares — the result must be screenshot-worthy
- **Picker Wheel:** The suspense animation matters (MaybeCat's "thinking" delay = this)
- **AI companions' sycophancy problem:** People are getting validation, not truth. The cat doesn't validate. That's the differentiator.

## The "Question Impulse" Opportunity

### Search volume (US monthly estimates)

| Query Pattern | Est. Searches | Current Results |
|--------------|--------------|-----------------|
| "should I text my ex" | 50K - 150K | 100% serious articles |
| "should I quit my job" | 50K - 100K | 100% serious articles |
| "should I text him/her" | 40K - 100K | Articles + quizzes |
| "what should I do" | 100K+ | Self-help + decision tools |
| "should I break up" | 30K - 80K | 100% serious articles |
| "help me decide" | 20K - 50K | Decision tools + articles |
| "is this a bad idea" | varies | Articles + TikTok |
| "is it worth it" | varies | Review sites + articles |
| "am I overthinking this" | varies | Mental health articles |

Aggregate "question impulse" long-tail: **millions per month**

### The psychology
- Most searchers already know what they want to do — looking for permission, not advice
- The act of asking IS the decision-making process
- A coin flip reveals what you actually want by how you feel about the result
- MaybeCat's responses do this at a deeper level — a layered answer gives you more to react to

### Decision fatigue tailwind
- Lightweight decision-tools are a documented growing trend (Android Headlines, Sept 2025)
- People want to "delegate decisions to chance or curated systems"
- Google is eating the utility layer (built-in coin flip) but can never have a character with attitude

## The Void With Voice

### The Opportunity
People ask questions into the void — Google, Reddit, 3 AM searches — and get 2,000-word articles, therapy-speak, or 47 Reddit comments when they need one sharp line. MaybeCat is the destination for those questions.

### 7 Void Categories
1. **Decision Paralysis** ("Should I...") — need permission, not pro/con lists
2. **Self-Doubt** ("Am I...") — need someone to say "you're okay," not clinical definitions
3. **Relationship Anxiety** ("Does he/she...") — #1 void category, pattern-matching for certainty
4. **Health Anxiety** ("Do I have...") — where searching makes it worse
5. **Existential** ("What's the point...") — 3 AM spirals that need something fast
6. **Permission-Seeking** ("Is it okay to...") — shame underneath, Google can't address it
7. **Hope/Future** ("Will I ever...") — motivation articles are both true and useless in crisis

### The 2-4 AM Window
Peak search time for these questions. Mean peak at 2:25 AM. Midnight brains need one sharp line, not a researched article. MaybeCat is built for this moment.

### Content Scaling Path
800 → 10,000 responses via handcrafted (~2K) + templates (~5K) + question-bucketed (~3K). Quality over quantity — curated, not AI jibberish. See `10-content-scaling-strategy.md`.

### Question Mining Sources
Reddit (r/AmItheAsshole, r/relationships, r/advice, r/NoStupidQuestions, r/TooAfraidToAsk), Quora, AnswerThePublic, AlsoAsked, Google autocomplete. Full research in `09-void-questions.md`.
