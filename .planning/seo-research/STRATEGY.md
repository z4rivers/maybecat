# MaybeCat SEO Strategy
*Established: 2026-02-09*

## Positioning Pivot
**FROM:** Oracle / Fortune Teller / Mystical cat reading
**TO:** Advice with a voice / Wingman cat / "Ask a cat, get answers, maybe"

### Why
The oracle/fortune space tops out at ~402K/month (Magic 8-Ball). The advice-with-voice space has sites pulling millions (Co-Star 20M downloads, Ask a Manager 3.86M/month). Voice is the differentiator, not format.

### The Rule
**Demonstrate, never claim.** Never call ourselves "funny" or "sassy" — the voice does that work or it doesn't.

### The Cat's Authority
The cat is the expert. Highly qualified. 10,000 years of judging humans. The only hedge is "maybe" — maybe the cat will answer, maybe not. The cat doesn't apologize for its authority.
