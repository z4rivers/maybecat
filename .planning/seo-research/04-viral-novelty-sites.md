# SEO Research: Viral Novelty & Fun Interactive Sites
*Research date: 2026-02-09*

## Key Finding
The #1 discovery channel for novelty sites is getting on "fun websites when bored" roundup lists. Cat Bounce (237K/month) proves a single-concept cat novelty site can pull real traffic. Share output (like Wordle's emoji grid) is the viral engine.

## Top Sites by Traffic
| Site | Monthly Traffic | What It Is |
|---|---|---|
| Neal.fun | 9.13M | Collection of web experiments (Infinite Craft, etc.) |
| The Useless Web | 776K | Random useless website launcher |
| Bored Button | 295K | Random fun site launcher |
| Cat Bounce | 237K | Bouncing cats (single concept) |
| Pointer Pointer | Strong | Photo of someone pointing at cursor |
| Eelslap | 160K | Slow-motion eel slap |
| Find the Invisible Cow | Popular | Audio-based hidden cow game |

## How They Get Discovered

### 1. "Fun Websites" Listicle Circuit (HIGHEST ROI)
- HUNDREDS of "fun websites when bored" articles exist (Parade, Hostinger, Webflow, Beebom, MakeUseOf)
- These rank for massive keywords ("fun websites", "bored", "cool websites")
- Cat Bounce and Pointer Pointer appear on nearly ALL of them
- Each inclusion = high-authority backlink + referral traffic
- Lists are actively maintained and updated annually
- **Action:** Pitch to writers who maintain these lists

### 2. Social Media Virality
- Twitter/X is primary launch platform (Neal.fun model)
- Reddit: r/InternetIsBeautiful (1.3M+ members), r/cats
- TikTok: "you have to try this" sharing format
- Product Hunt and Hacker News for initial spike

### 3. Built-In Share Output (The Wordle Effect)
- Wordle: colored emoji grid → 400K shares/day at peak
- BuzzFeed quizzes: identity-affirming results → 52K avg Facebook shares
- Key: output must be visual, intriguing, and non-spoiling
- MaybeCat's share card (cat photo + response) fits this model

### 4. Name = Search Term
- The Useless Web ranks for "useless web"
- Bored Button ranks for "bored button"
- MaybeCat → need to own "ask a cat" and "cat advice" instead

## Key Patterns
- Simple, single-purpose concept
- Instantly shareable
- Zero friction (no signup, no explanation needed)
- Being the definitive answer to a common query = unbeatable SEO position

## Benchmark for MaybeCat
Cat Bounce: 237K/month with zero content, just bouncing cats.
MaybeCat has richer concept, shelter cats, shareable outputs, 800+ responses.
Should be able to match or exceed with proper SEO and listicle outreach.
