# Research: "Just Give Me An Answer" Destinations
*2026-02-09*

## The Landscape

The "give me a random answer" space is massive in aggregate but fragmented into personality-free utility tools. Nobody has combined fun + voice + shareability.

## The Giants (Millions of Visitors)

| Site | Monthly Traffic | Personality | Shareable |
|------|---------------|-------------|-----------|
| Wheel of Names | 19.7M | Zero | Only via screenshare |
| Picker Wheel | 2-4.1M | Zero | No |
| Wheel Decide | 1.5-1.85M | Zero | No |
| Akinator | 2.3M web + 100M app downloads | YES (smug genie) | Extremely |
| flipsimu.com | 983K | Zero | No |

### Akinator — The Character Proof
- The genie character IS the product
- Turban, smug expression when he guesses right
- "Akinator guessed [obscure character]" is a meme format
- YouTube videos with millions of views
- **Proof that wrapping an algorithm in a CHARACTER creates an entirely different product than a bare utility**

## The Classic: Magic 8-Ball Sites

- magic-8ball.com: ~402K/month
- 20 stock answers since 1946
- Web clones are generic — the mystique of the physical toy doesn't translate
- Answers so well-known they create no surprise
- "Reply hazy, try again" doesn't make anyone screenshot
- **The format is RECOGNIZABLE but EXHAUSTED**

---

## Yes/No Decision Sites

### yesno.wtf
- Yes/no + random reaction GIF
- The GIF provides the personality
- More shareable than most — GIF format inherently shareable
- Has a public API (developer adoption signal)
- **Understood that the answer doesn't matter — the REACTION to the answer matters**

### yesornobutton.com / yesnobutton.com / generateyesno.com
- Multiple identical sites, zero differentiation
- Big colored buttons, generic
- The sheer number of identical sites proves: easy to build, nobody has differentiated

## Character-Based Answer Experiences

### Co-Star — The Growth Model to Study
- 30M+ registered users. 25% of US women 18-25.
- Notifications are blunt, snarky, savage: "Don't text him back just because you're bored"
- **Screenshot-native:** Detects screenshots, pushes notification "tag us"
- Co-Star Notifications is a documented meme on Know Your Meme
- BuzzFeed compiled "17 Co-Star memes"
- **What it proves:** Voice turns generic content into a viral, shareable experience
- **The formula:** FORMAT (notification) + VOICE (savage) + SHAREABILITY (screenshot detection)

But Co-Star is:
1. Astrology-locked (need birth chart)
2. One tone (cryptic/savage) — no dynamic range
3. Push-only — you can't ask it things

### Character.AI
- 20M MAU, 180M+ monthly web visits, 40M+ app downloads
- Chat with AI characters
- Screenshots of wild conversations are a social media genre
- **People WANT to talk to characters. The appeal is the character, not the information.**

### Cleverbot
- ~180K/month (declined — ChatGPT ate its lunch)
- Charm was its incoherence — weird things, people screenshotted the chaos
- When you can talk to a smart AI, chaotically dumb loses novelty

---

## Fortune Cookie Generators
- Multiple sites, all low traffic
- Zero personality, generic database of fortunes
- **Why they fail:** "Good things come to those who wait" is not a screenshot

## The Gap Analysis

| Element | Wheels | 8-Ball | Yes/No | Co-Star | Character.AI | MaybeCat |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|---------|-------------|----------|
| Gives an answer | Random | 20 fixed | Binary | Daily push | Chat | 800+ |
| Has character/voice | No | Barely | No | YES | Varies | YES |
| Answers are surprising | No | No (known) | No | YES | Yes | YES |
| Built for screenshots | No | No | Kinda (GIF) | YES | Kinda | Potential |
| Ask anything | No (you pick options) | Yes | Yes | No (pushed) | Yes | YES |
| Has attitude | No | No | No | YES | Varies | YES |
| Multiple interpretations | No | No | No | Sometimes | N/A | YES |
| Short/punchline format | N/A | Yes but stale | N/A | Yes | No | YES |

## Key Finding

**No site on the internet currently occupies this intersection:**

> Ask a question -> Get a short, sharp answer with a distinctive character voice -> The answer is inherently screenshottable -> The experience has personality

Co-Star is closest but astrology-locked and push-only.
Magic 8-Ball has the right format but zero voice.
yesno.wtf has the right instinct but no character.

**The "character-driven answer to questions" slot is empty.**

## What MaybeCat Can Learn From Winners

1. **From Picker Wheel / Wheel Decide:** The suspense animation matters. The wait IS the experience. (MaybeCat's "thinking" delay serves this purpose.)
2. **From yesno.wtf:** The response format is the product, not the accuracy.
3. **From WTF Dinner:** Voice alone can turn a single-serving site into a brand.
4. **From BuzzFeed quizzes:** The share mechanic is everything. The result must be screenshot-worthy.
5. **From "Should I Text Him" quizzes:** People want PERMISSION, not advice.
6. **From Akinator:** Wrapping an algorithm in a character creates an entirely different product.
7. **From Co-Star:** Screenshot detection + share prompting = growth engine.
8. **From flipism:** A coin flip reveals what you ACTUALLY want by how you feel about the result. MaybeCat's responses do this at a deeper level.

## Additional Observations

- Google is eating the utility layer ("flip a coin" built into search). Good for MaybeCat — Google will never have a cat with attitude.
- BuzzFeed quiz model is the shareability proof: 75% of quiz traffic from social shares. You get a RESULT that says something about YOU, so you share it. MaybeCat responses function the same way.
