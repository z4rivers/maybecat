# SEO Research: Decision Helper & Question Sites
*Research date: 2026-02-09*

## Key Finding
The "I have a question, give me SOMETHING back" space is massive but nobody has curated quality + personality + shareability + a character. Co-Star ($800K/month) proved attitude sells. MaybeCat sits in an empty lane.

## I Ching Sites (OG Question→Wisdom Format)
| Site | Monthly Traffic | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ichingonline.net | 67-76K | Richard Wilhelm translation. Reverent, scholarly, zero personality. |
| ifate.com | 153K, 1050 pages | Multi-tool fortune site. Walmart of divination. ~$979/mo ad revenue. |
| iching.today | Small | I Ching with AI interpretation. Offers follow-up questions. |

## Decision Makers
| Site | Monthly Traffic | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Picker Wheel | 2-5.85M | Market leader. Customizable wheel. |
| Wheel Decide | 1.85M | Premade themed wheels (Wheel of Dinner). |
| Wheel of Names | Very popular | Primarily classroom use. |
| justdecideapp.com | Small | Input options, get random pick. |

These all require YOU to provide options. MaybeCat only requires a QUESTION. Lower friction.

## Novelty Answer Sites
| Site | Notes |
|---|---|
| InspiroBot (inspirobot.me) | 46-61K/mo. Satirical AI quotes on random backgrounds. CLOSEST COMP to MaybeCat. |
| Wisdom of Chopra | 146K Facebook shares. Fake Deepak Chopra quotes. Strong concept = viral. |
| Oblique Strategies | Brian Eno's creative prompts. Cult following among creatives. Same "click, get cryptic wisdom" mechanic. |
| Shower Thoughts generators | Pull from r/ShowerThoughts (26M members). Observations, not answers. |
| Bad Advice generators | askbadadvice.com, badadvice.lol — gimmicky, funny once. |

## Compliment/Affirmation Generators
- getyourcompliments.com, affirmationflow.com — pure positivity dispensers
- Gap: MaybeCat captures "I need to hear something" with ATTITUDE, not just compliments

## The Co-Star Benchmark (Tone Comp)
- 20M+ downloads, $800K monthly revenue
- "Biting truth," "provocative" push notifications
- Quarter of US women 18-25 have it
- They proved: attitude sells in the "tell me about my life" category
- They didn't win because astrology. They won because VOICE.

## Why MaybeCat Wins This Lane
1. **Curated quality** — 800+ hand-written responses vs. generic/AI slop
2. **Character people love** — Cats. Not crystals, not algorithms, not generic oracles.
3. **Shelter cats** — Real adoption angle nobody else has
4. **Share mechanic** — PNG share card = Wordle-equivalent viral potential
5. **Low friction** — Ask anything, no options to input, no signup
6. **Repeat visits** — 800+ responses across 12 categories = come back energy
