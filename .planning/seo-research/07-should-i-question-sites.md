# Research: "Should I..." Question Sites
*2026-02-09*

## Who Owns the "Should I...?" Question Moment

The "should I...?" impulse moment is surprisingly fragmented. Nobody truly OWNS it. The space is split across generic utility tools, quiz sites, novelty one-pagers, and Reddit.

## TIER 1: Utility Decision Tools (Biggest Traffic)

Mechanical, personality-free, purely functional.

| Site | Monthly Traffic | What It Does |
|------|---------------|--------------|
| Picker Wheel | 4.1M | Custom spinner wheel |
| Wheel of Names | 13-19M | Custom spinner wheel |
| Wheel Decide | 1.85M | Custom spinner wheel |
| flipsimu.com | 737K | Coin flip simulator |
| justflipacoin.com | 370K | Coin flip (since 2010) |

**Key insight:** 25+ million monthly visits to personality-free decision tools. The suspense animation (spinning, flipping) IS the experience. flipsimu wins over justflipacoin by making the flip FEEL real (physics, sound). The tactile experience matters even digitally.

Google's built-in "flip a coin" is eating standalone coin flip sites.

## TIER 2: Personality / Novelty Layer

### yesno.wtf
- Yes/no answer + random reaction GIF
- The GIF IS the product. The answer is the excuse.
- Has an API developers use
- Perfect domain name for virality
- CLOSEST parallel to MaybeCat's instinct: understood that the RESPONSE format matters more than accuracy

### WTF Should I Make for Dinner (whatthefuckshouldimakefordinner.com)
- Profanity-laced random dinner suggestions
- Became a published COOKBOOK
- Proved a single-serving site with VOICE can become a brand
- The swearing IS the product
- Spawned copycats (WTF Should I Be for Halloween, etc.)
- Owned a micro-moment through voice alone

### Magic 8-Ball Sites (magic-8ball.com etc.)
- ~402K/month fragmented across many domains
- 20 preset answers from 1946
- Built on decades of physical product brand recognition
- But NOBODY has modernized the voice. Every clone replicates the same 20 answers.

## TIER 3: Quiz Industrial Complex

### BuzzFeed Quizzes
- "What City Should You Actually Live In?" — 20M+ views
- Average quiz: 51,968 Facebook shares vs 15,527 for articles
- 70% mobile traffic
- People don't want an answer; they want to be TOLD something about themselves
- The share mechanic IS the product

### "Should I Text Him" Quiz Sites
- brainfall.com, marriage.com, quizexpo.com, thoughtcatalog.com
- ProProfs version alone: 16,780 attempts
- Psychology: nobody taking this quiz wants to hear "no"
- The quiz is a ritual of justification, not actual decision-making

## Key Finding

The "should I..." question moment is currently answered ONLY by:
1. **Serious articles** (2,000 words about boundaries when someone at 1 AM wants 2 seconds)
2. **Generic quizzes** (no brand, no character, no reason to return)
3. **Random generators** (yes/no buttons, wheels — millions of users, zero personality)
4. **Nothing in between**

Nobody has a character-driven, screenshot-worthy answer to "should I...?" questions.
