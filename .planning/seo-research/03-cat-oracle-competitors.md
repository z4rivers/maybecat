# SEO Research: Cat + Oracle Direct Competitors
*Research date: 2026-02-09*

## Key Finding
The "cat oracle" web space is essentially EMPTY. One hobby project on Netlify. Physical card decks sell well (300% Kickstarter funding) which validates demand. Nobody has built the web experience.

## Direct Competitors

### Web-Based
| Site | Threat | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Sassy Cat Oracle (sassyoracle.netlify.app) | Low | Hobby project, Netlify subdomain, 1 page indexed |

| CatGPT Meme Generator (pollinations.github.io) | Very Low | AI meme generator, GitHub Pages |
| Ask a Cat webcomic (askacat.thecomicstrip.org) | Low | Ended 2019, owns some "ask a cat" keyword space |

### Blogs/Content
| Site | Threat | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Cat Wisdom 101 (catwisdom101.com) | Medium keyword | 15 years of "cat fortune" content |
| Sparkle Cat / Dear Sparkle | Low | Cat advice column from cat's perspective |
| Way of Cats | Very Low | Cat advice blog |

### Physical Products (validates demand)
| Product | Notes |

## Keyword Gaps (Zero Competition)
- "cat oracle online" — no interactive web tool ranks
- "ask a cat oracle" — uncontested
- "cat fortune teller online" — no one owns this
- "funny cat oracle" — only sassyoracle barely indexed
- "shelter cat oracle" — completely uncontested
- "cat magic 8 ball online" — empty
- "cat decision maker" — empty

## Validation
- Physical cat oracle decks sell well
- Considerate Cat Tarot: rescue-cat angle funded 300% on Kickstarter
- CatGPT went viral proving the concept has legs
- But NO web experience combines cats + questions + curated voice + shelter adoption
