# SEO Research: Cat Humor & Entertainment Sites
*Research date: 2026-02-09*

## Key Finding
No one dominates the "interactive cat + humor + advice" intersection. The space is either dead blogs, aggregators, or novelty toys. Nobody has an interactive *experience* with actual voice.

## Major Sites

### Tier 1: High Traffic
| Site | Monthly Traffic | Type |
|---|---|---|
| TheCatSite.com | ~903K | Forum/community |
| Cat Bounce (cat-bounce.com) | ~237K | Interactive novelty (bouncing cats) |
| The Discerning Cat | ~200K pageviews | Blog |
| I Can Has Cheezburger | ~1.5K (dead, was 1.5M/day) | Legacy meme site |
| Bored Panda /cats | Millions (parent) | Aggregator |

### Tier 2: Niche
- **HTTP Cats (http.cat)** — Cat per HTTP status code. Developer humor. Gets backlinks from dev blogs constantly.
- **TheCatMeme.com** — Meme aggregator, exact-match domain play
- **Three Chatty Cats** — Personal cat blog since 2016
- **OwlKitty** — Cat photoshopped into movies. Creator-driven, social-first.
- **Cat Bounce** — 237K/month from a single-concept novelty site. Proof interactive cat sites can pull real traffic with ZERO content.
- **Catleidoscope** — Kaleidoscope of internet cats. Press coverage from Laughing Squid, HuffPost.

## Gaps
1. No interactive cat + humor experience exists online
2. Cat Bounce proves single-concept novelty sites pull real traffic (237K/month)
3. "Cat oracle" / "ask a cat" — wide open, returns physical products not web apps
4. Cat + humor content is all aggregation, never interactive
5. TikTok cat creators (19.9M followers for top ones) need content to share
