# Void Questions Research
*Compiled: 2026-02-09*

## The Insight

People ask questions into the void — Google, Reddit, 3 AM searches — and get 2,000-word articles, therapy-speak, or 47 Reddit comments when they need one sharp line. These are questions without a satisfying destination.

MaybeCat is the destination.

## The 7 Void Categories

### 1. Decision Paralysis ("Should I...")

**Example questions:** Should I break up with them? Should I quit my job? Should I text them first? Should I go back to school? Should I move to a new city? Should I confront them about this? Should I say something? Should I forgive them? Should I invest in this? Should I ask them out? Should I tell them the truth? Should I take the risk? Should I apologize? Should I give them a second chance? Should I stay or go? Should I trust my gut?

**Why Google fails:** Articles present pro/con lists that apply to everyone and no one. The answer is "it depends," which people already know. They need *permission* or *absolution*, not decision matrices.

### 2. Self-Doubt ("Am I...")

**Example questions:** Am I normal? Am I good enough? Am I too old? Am I smart enough? Am I attractive? Am I overreacting? Am I crazy? Am I the problem? Am I toxic? Am I being selfish? Am I depressed? Am I anxious? Am I really in love? Am I a bad person? Am I wasting my life? Am I the only one who feels this way?

**Why Google fails:** Results offer validation ("You're not alone!") or clinical definitions that don't match the specific spiral someone is in. Nobody finds the answer they need because the question is really "Am I okay?" and Google can't say that.

### 3. Relationship Anxiety ("Does he/she..." / "Why doesn't he/she...")

The **#1 void category** — obsessive pattern-matching looking for certainty where none exists.

**Example questions:** Does he like me? Does she like me? Is he interested? Is she interested in me or just being nice? Does he think about me? Does she miss me? Will he come back? Will they realize what they lost? Why doesn't he text me back? Why doesn't she want to hang out? Does he actually care about me? Is he playing games? Is she losing interest? Will they ever change? Does he have feelings for me? Why is he being distant?

**Why Google fails:** Articles list "signs" but those signs are contradictory and subjective. You can find "he's ignoring you because he likes you" and "he's ignoring you because he doesn't" on the same search page. Ambiguous signals are ambiguous. Google can't decode someone else's mind.

### 4. Health Anxiety & Panic ("Do I have..." / "What does it mean if...")

The anxiety *fuel* category — where searching makes things worse, not better.

**Example questions:** Do I have anxiety? Do I have cancer? Do I have a heart problem? Do I have depression? Do I have OCD? What does a racing heart mean? What if I'm dying? Why is my chest tight? Why am I so tired all the time? Can stress cause [serious symptom]? Am I having a stroke? Do I have Parkinson's disease? What does it mean if I can't sleep? Is a headache a sign of something serious? Why do I feel dizzy? What causes brain fog?

**Why Google fails:** Search results present medical possibilities in worst-first order. Confirmation bias kicks in: you find one article saying "chest pain can indicate a heart condition" and ignore 100 saying it's probably anxiety. WebMD becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.

### 5. Existential ("What's the point..." / "Why am I...")

Late-night spiral questions people ask Google privately because they can't ask humans.

**Example questions:** What is the meaning of life? What's the point of anything? Why do I feel empty? Why am I so tired all the time? Why does nobody like me? Why am I alone? Why do I care what people think? What happens after death? Why do dreams feel so real? Do animals have souls? Is my life wasted? Why does nothing matter? What is consciousness? Does free will exist? Why do I feel disconnected? What's the point of trying?

**Why Google fails:** Results are either vapid (fortune cookie wisdom) or so intellectually abstract they don't touch the real feeling of despair. Someone at 3 AM doesn't need Descartes; they need *something* to feel less alone.

### 6. Permission-Seeking ("Is it okay to..." / "Is it normal to...")

People looking for reassurance that their feelings/desires/behaviors aren't wrong.

**Example questions:** Is it okay to be selfish sometimes? Is it normal to have doubts about my relationship? Is it normal to not want kids? Is it normal to feel alone in a relationship? Is it okay to leave a job without something lined up? Is it normal to want to be alone? Is it normal to not like family gatherings? Is it okay to say no? Is it normal to fantasize about leaving? Is it normal to be afraid of commitment? Is it okay to prioritize myself? Is it normal to have intrusive thoughts? Is it okay to change my mind? Is it normal to cry for no reason? Is it okay to not have my life figured out?

**Why Google fails:** Results offer clinical reassurance ("Most people experience this") without addressing the shame underneath. The actual question is "Will people judge me for this?" and Google can't promise they won't.

### 7. Hope / Future Certainty ("Will I ever..." / "Is it too late to...")

Questions asked during moments of despair or hesitation.

**Example questions:** Will I ever find love? Will I ever be happy? Will I ever succeed? Will they ever forgive me? Will it get better? Will I ever figure this out? Is it too late to start over? Is it too late to change careers? Is it too late to go back to school? Is it too late to move? Is it too late to fix this? Will I ever be good enough? Will things ever go back to normal? Is it too late to have kids? Will people ever understand me?

**Why Google fails:** Nobody can predict the future. Articles offer motivation instead of honesty. "It's never too late!" is both true and useless to someone in crisis.

## Volume Data & The 2-4 AM Peak

### Peak Search Time: The 2-4 AM Window
Insomnia-related searches peak around 3 AM across all US states, with the mean peak at 2:25 AM. This is when anxiety and existential dread hit hardest.

### Pogo-Sticking Evidence
Users who encounter unsatisfying results don't stay on the first link. They bounce back and click elsewhere. While Google doesn't use pogo-sticking as a ranking signal, it reveals the truth: the top results aren't satisfying people's actual needs.

### The Cyberchondria Spiral
When people Google symptoms, they find worst-case scenarios. One result leads to another, and everyone thinks they have a terminal disease. The search is supposed to *reduce* anxiety but spirals it instead.

### 1 in 3 Americans
have asked Google an existential question, often privately at night when they're too tired, anxious, or uncomfortable to ask a human.

### Why The Void Exists

1. **Timing problem** — Most unanswerable questions get asked at 2-4 AM. Google's top results are written for daytime research (articles with nuance, complexity, hedging). Midnight brains need something faster.

2. **Bounce rate problem** — Questions that spark pogo-sticking indicate the answer isn't on the page. But Google doesn't show that data publicly.

3. **Volume isn't authority** — The most-asked questions ("What to watch?", "What dinosaur has 500 teeth?") are easy to answer. The questions with real emotional weight don't rank because they're too personal, unanswerable, or contradictory.

4. **The therapy-speak wall** — Articles that DO rank use therapy language ("Have you considered your attachment style?") that talks AROUND the real feeling instead of hitting it directly.

## What MaybeCat Can Do That Google Can't

- **Name the feeling directly** — cut through the therapy-speak
- **Be oblique but honest** — the answer to "Does he like me?" could be devastating or hilarious depending on how you read it
- **Offer perspective shift** — not "you should text him" but a reframe that catches them off-guard
- **Be SHORT** — nobody wants 2,000 words at 3 AM
- **Sound like someone who actually gets it** — not Google results, not a therapist, not an advice column

What the cat doesn't need to do: predict the future, give universal advice, apply clinical frameworks, hedge with disclaimers.

---

## The Pattern Across All Categories

People aren't looking for information. They're looking for permission, validation, or just someone to say SOMETHING back. At 3 AM, a 2,000-word article about attachment styles is the worst possible result. A cat with one sharp line is better.

Reddit's answer to "should I text my ex" is 47 comments, half of them projecting their own breakup, one genuinely helpful buried at the bottom, and the thread gets locked. A cat with one sharp line is a better experience for most people asking that question at 1 AM.
